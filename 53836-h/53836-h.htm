<p>Numbering and labelling of illustrations is somewhat flawed.
Figure 20 does not exist and figures 18–24 are not in correct numerical

actually identify labelled items in figure 18 on page 91. Some
illustration labels are very difficult to read. </p>

<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>Within the last three decades the diagnosis
and treatment of bowel troubles have been
greatly changed through improved instruments,
technique, hygienic measures, and various remedial
agents.</p>

<p>The domain of surgery of the anus, rectum, etc.,
has been surprisingly limited, and that of gastro-intestinal
hygiene enlarged, together with knowledge
of man’s assimilative and eliminative organs.
Systemic and local hygiene has supplanted drugs
and surgery in the treatment of diseases of the
anus, rectum, sigmoid flexure, and vermiform appendix.
Indeed, the domain of surgery will be
restricted to what are still considered incurable
diseases if the suggestions of this volume are
widely adopted. From a clinical experience extending
over a period of thirty-three years, however,&mdash;as
a specialist in diseases of the anus,
rectum, and intestinal machinery generally,&mdash;the
author feels warranted in maintaining that, if hygio-therapic
measures were taken by both physicians
and laymen, surgical clinics and hospitals<span class="pagenum" title="vi"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi"></a></span>
for “operating” on anal and rectal diseases and
the administering of countless medicinal remedies
would enter the stage of therapeutic oblivion.</p>

<p>The present work is more comprehensive in its
scope than its title, <i>Intestinal Irrigation</i>, would
at first thought seem to indicate. It is a practical
book on home relief for all the symptoms of that
form of internal inflammation known as proctitis
and colitis. The measures that may safely be
taken by the victim himself, without consulting a
physician, are minutely explained; and, that he
may understand his own case, every chapter goes
more or less extensively into anatomical, physio­logic­al,
and pathological details.</p>

<p>The author has kept abreast of the advancement
of science in relation to his special branch of the
healing art, and as the outcome of his large daily
experience in this line he feels qualified to speak
with authority. Victims of any of the symptoms
described in this book may therefore have confidence
in its statements. It conveys a message of
common sense to the world at large and to the victims
of intestinal ills in particular. It is a compilation
of clinical talks to the author’s patients,
making plain a variety of symptoms arising from
a single primary cause.</p>

<p>As the purpose of the book is pre-eminently<span class="pagenum" title="vii"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii"></a></span>
practical, the author felt warranted in describing
minutely his own clinics, so far as any patient
could apply the results to his individual needs.
This, therefore, is the author’s excuse for introducing
his own appliances and describing their
features and uses. Certain work must be done
by the sufferer himself, and no other invention in
the market will aid him so materially in doing this
work scientifically and efficiently.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it was found impossible for the
author to describe what he himself was doing as a
rectal specialist, or to direct sufferers on the road
to relief, unless he stated how certain appliances
should be employed. In the following pages, consequently,
the reader will learn just what to do, for
the work is above all things simple and direct, and
in the writer’s judgment has the sterling quality of
common sense.</p>

<p>Some of the chapters have already appeared, in
abridged form, in the magazine <i>Health</i>, as contributed
essays; but the text has been elaborated in
the following pages and much new matter added,
in order that the work should present the most
mature information concerning the subjects discussed.</p>

<hr class="r10" />
<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />

<span class="smcap">Efforts to Overcome Constipation without
Seeking its Cause.</span></h2>


<p>In the year 1496 an Italian, Gatenaria, invented
an appliance for taking an enema; since that
time depuratory instruments have had more or less
vogue in all civilized countries. Of late years inventive
powers have been taxed to construct more
convenient and effective appliances, and now perfection
has been almost reached, and the poor civilizee,
whose habits are really very bad from the
savage point of view, may enjoy the delicious privilege
of an internal bath whenever he feels the need
of it. By any other name this bath is just as purifying:
call it irrigation, injection, lavement, clyster,
enema&mdash;its many names and what they mean
testify to the fact that it is for the disease of civil­iza­tion.</p>

<p>The medical profession is really behind the layman
in genuine therapeutic measures. It still cares
more for the pill-and-powder-prescription-earning
fee than for the real health of the patient. When<span class="pagenum" title="2"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a></span>
it shall wean itself from its sordid commercialism,
it will make the use of the enema a fundamental
factor in most forms of therapeutic treatment, and
then the enema will become universal.</p>

<p>From the origin of the enema to the present day,
the layman has not been unmindful of this valuable
resource for removing morbid matter from his
physiological sewer. The great relief he thus obtained,
and the invariably good results that followed
its use, established as a necessary toilet article some
form of depuratory apparatus in many homes for
all time to come.</p>

<p>But of the nature of the disease that had occasioned
its use, both layman and physician were, and
for the most part are, ignorant. Local obstruction
and discomfort were sufficient to suggest this mode
of relief; yet no truly scientific inquiry seems to
have been instituted to discover the cause of the
obstruction. The author, during an experience of
over twenty-three years as a specialist in diseases
of the bowels, rectum, and anus, has found the true
cause, namely, <span class="smcap">Proctitis</span>; that is, the chronic inflammation
(dating often from infancy and childhood)
of the anus, rectum, and frequently of a
portion of the sigmoid flexure and colon. Proctitis
is practically the universal cause of chronic con­sti­pa­tion.
Victims of con­sti­pa­tion have more or less
haphazardly resorted to the enema as a ready means
of relief&mdash;a recourse that was often, nay generally,
against the advice of their medical counselor: a
professional opposition that indicates either ignorance,<span class="pagenum" title="3"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a></span>
mistaken judgment, or fear of losing a
profitable patient. But the layman has not been
uniformly wise. He is an experimenter on his own
hook&mdash;encouraged in his experiments by the most
promising and seductive of advertisements in the
whole gamut of advertising. He experimented on
his organism, tinkering it now with cathartics or
purgatives of multiform nature, and again with
digestive and other agents. This tinkering habit
seems to have become all but universal with civilized
man. Constipation&mdash;which is caused by
proctitis&mdash;will, of course, bring indigestion and
bilious­ness and diarrhea and nervous­ness and
headache and a host of other maladies in its train;
all of these induce the civilizee to increase his tinkering
with his divine abode until it eventually falls
in ruins. The tinkerer loses sight of the fact that
his abode is not a body like the bodies of wood,
stone, and iron that he handles and putters with
daily; he forgets or ignores the fact that it is a
vital organic machine, which, when tinkered too
much, will stop, “never to go again.” It is poor
consolation when you have reached your last gasp,
after a chronic invalidism, to feel that you have
done the best you knew how. You have not sought
the cause, nor, having learned it somehow, sought
to remove or avoid it. For the last four hundred
years this tinkering, this futile medication, has been
kept up at a furious pace without even a hope of
permanent cure. Poor, outraged human nature
dimly knew that it was simply doctoring a symptom,<span class="pagenum" title="4"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a></span>
a <i>consequence</i> of something or other&mdash;for that
is all that con­sti­pa­tion and its host of symptoms
really are.</p>

<p>The writer is of the opinion that con­sti­pa­tion is
the fundamental disease that afflicts mankind; that,
at all events, there are more cases of proctitis than
of any other disease; that very few “civilized” persons
are free from it; that so prevalent a disease
must have a common origin, which he traces right
back to babyhood, to the wearing of soiled diapers,
a practice that cannot but result in inflammation of
the buttocks and mucous membrane of the anus
and rectum; and that this inflammation continues
and finally becomes deepened and established, producing
in after years chronic con­sti­pa­tion and its
train of evils. Of course, there are other causes
that bring on proctitis among children and adults;
but careful examination shows that the severity of
the malady with its train indicates long duration in
the tissues comprising the wall of the anal and rectal
canals and the adjoining tissues of the bowels.</p>

<p>Proctitis, with its extension, colitis, is by no means
a slight disease, as it is supposed to be by a few members
of the medical fraternity who are beginning to
apprehend its existence; on the contrary, it is so
serious that its gravity cannot be impressed too
forcibly upon both laymen and physicians. During
the many years of special attention the writer has
given to diseases of the anus, rectum, colon, etc.,
he has not ceased to wonder how it was possible
that the victim of deep-seated proctitis could have<span class="pagenum" title="5"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a></span>
so dreadful a disease and not be greatly alarmed
at its ravages and dangers. The anatomy, physiology,
and hygiene of the parts involved in this
inflammation continue in some manner to permit
the passage of excrement along the diseased canal;
and the victim continues to swallow drugs and
tinker with these&mdash;his irreplaceable “inards.<span class="nowrap">”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></span></p>

<p>It is not my purpose at present to go into a detailed
description of the organs involved in this
inflammatory process, but to make plain why the
enema is superior to all other means of securing
cleanliness. When we know why we do a thing,
the task is not so difficult and annoying as when we
go it blind or simply obey the behest of a physician.
Ignorance has no business bothering with
anything; experience, however, is usually a painful
if not a fatal instructor. The human race at large is
ignorant concerning the normal and abnormal processes
of its internal organs. “Out of sight, out of
mind” seems to be the maxim of almost every one
as to our vital organs and the conditions for their
hygienic functioning. The purpose of the writer
will be achieved if he succeed in sounding a note
of warning that will be heard and heeded by those
whose influence will extend the echoes till the world
listens and learns the claims of the inner physiological
economy.</p>

<p>Those that possess even a modicum of sense will<span class="pagenum" title="6"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a></span>
easily understand how a muscular tube like the
anus, rectum, sigmoid flexure, etc., when invaded
and traversed for eight to ten or more inches by
disease, will offer obstruction to the descent and
escape of gases and feces. All are familiar with
the contraction that occurs when a finger, hand, or
limb is inflamed; how little we can then use the
diseased part until all of the inflammation has left
the muscular tissue. Why do we give so much
attention to an inflamed external part and none at
all to the all-important internal organ for the expulsion
of the sewage of the body? The parts are
not “weak” when contracted with inflammation:
weakness is not what is the matter with them. The
trouble is that the muscular fiber is then too active,
made so by the excessive irritation of the local disorder.
Irritation of muscular tissue always causes
contraction of its fiber. Such contraction well
accounts for con­sti­pa­tion.</p>

<p>We are a nation of con­sti­pated people, so con­sti­pated
indeed that we have developed dyspepsia and
neurasthenia. As I have already stated, the chief
ill of “civilized” people is proctitis; the chief symptom
of proctitis is con­sti­pa­tion; the chief symptom
of con­sti­pa­tion is dyspepsia; and the chief symptom
of dyspepsia is neurasthenia, and so on and
on&mdash;all of them the outcome of imperfect elimination
of morbid matter from the intestinal canal.</p>

<p>The common sense learned in the treatment of
external parts should be applied to such diseased
portions of the body as the anus, rectum, etc.<span class="pagenum" title="7"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a></span>
Common sense declares that an enema ought to be
used on all occasions of undue retention of the contents
of the bowels. It is the only sensible thing
under the circum­stances. Yet, for the last four
hundred years, only independent men and women
have had the courage to proclaim its merits, since
the subject was under the ban of both laymen and
physicians. Now that we have learned the absolute
necessity of such a device, it is to be hoped
that the taboo will be removed, and that the numerous
victims of proctitis will be instructed in the
wisdom of availing themselves of the valuable aid
of the enema in either curing proctitis or preventing
it from growing worse, while they are at the
same time securing relief through its use by the removal
of feces and gases several times daily, thus
preventing the absorption of poison, which the
retention of waste invariably facilitates.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />

<span class="smcap">Pathology of the Anus and Rectum; or, The
Genesis of Constipation.</span></h2>


<p>When an affliction is seemingly universal it is
reasonable to conclude that it springs from
universal conditions. Proctitis, the most widespread
disease of civilized man, originates very
early in life, and develops in after years numerous
painful symptoms&mdash;such as piles or hemorrhoids,
con­sti­pa­tion, etc.</p>

<p>Now, what is the most common exciter of proctitis,
which, as has been said, is an inflammation of
the mucous membrane of the anus and rectum?
In my earlier work, <i>Intestinal Ills</i>, I have shown
that inattention to the soiled diaper is generally the
original cause of this most grievous of ills, with its
train of malign consequences continuing throughout
the victim’s life on earth. Unnoticed by nurse
or mother, the inflammation of the anus and rectum
makes headway with each subsequent soiling; and
thereafter, when the use of the diaper is dispensed
with, inattention to the normal action of the bowels,
improper food, the resort to purgatives, stimulants,
and opiates, play no small part in aggravating the
existing malady.</p>

<p>A portion of the wall of the rectum has been removed exposing various
layers: 1, serous layer; 2, muscular layers; 3, 3, submucous layers; 4, 4,

<p>The first care-taker of the infant is therefore responsible
for the initial process, which progresses
to a chronic condition by subsequent
inattention. She is indeed
solicitous over the inflamed buttocks
of her charge, but overlooks
the far more dangerous inflammation
of the mucous membrane
of the anus and rectum, or she
does not realize its insidious
and subtly progressive character.
Candidates for motherhood
should be instructed on this momentous
subject.</p>

<p>There are other exciting causes
of proctitis, but, since they are
exceptional when compared with
the neglected diaper, we need
not concern ourselves with them
at present.</p>

<p>The muscular coat of the rectum
consists of two layers: an
inner circular and an outer longitudinal
band. The inner circular
layer of muscular tissue of the
rectum forms the internal sphincter
muscle; and the outer longitudinal
bands merge with those
of the external sphincter. The
anal orifice is closed or guarded by two strong
sphincter muscles, as shown in Figs.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_1">1</a>, 2, and 3.<span class="pagenum" title="11"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a></span>
These muscles are abundantly supplied with nerves,
of which branches are distributed to the bladder
and other adjacent organs, which accounts for the
sympathy of these organs and their grave disturbance
when disease inheres in the anus and
rectum.</p>

<p>The orifice used for the elimination of undigested
food and waste matter plays quite as important
a part in the organic economy as the orifice that is
employed for receiving food. Normal elimination,<span class="pagenum" title="12"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12"></a></span>
physiological and psychological, is the correlative
process to prehension (seizure or appropriation),
and the concord of the two forms the key-note of
the organism.</p>

<p>The muscles and tissues constituting the anal
vent should be as flexible and responsive to the
will or desire of the rectum for relief of its contents
as the lips are in permitting the saliva to escape.
In like manner the upper portion of the rectum
(Figs.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_6">6</a> and <a href="#Fig_8">8</a>) should respond with instant readiness
to the effort of the sigmoid flexure to expel its
contents. But an abnormal condition like inflammation
rooted in the anus and lower part of the
rectum (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_1">1</a>, 4–4) will inhibit the passage of
the pressing burden above them, which inhibition
will cause the inflammation to extend to the sigmoid
flexure, and thence on to the colon proper;
and sooner or later the inflammation will penetrate
the submucous coat (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_1">1</a>, 3–3), which is composed
of fatty or areolar connective tissue in which
trunks of nerves and blood-vessels are imbedded.</p>

<p>The first symptom of inflammation is undue redness,
followed by slight puffiness of the anal and
rectal mucous membrane (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_1">1</a>, 4–4), with more
or less sensitiveness of the tissues involved; and as
its irritability increases there is more or less contraction
of the muscular tissue forming the anus
and rectum, which lessens the diameter of their
bore. And the consequence of this contraction is
of physiological concern to the victim, for in proportion
to the contraction the normal demand of<span class="pagenum" title="13"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13"></a></span>
the victim for relief of the impending feces and gas
is modified and lessened.</p>

<p>In health, the anal canal is from two to three
inches in length, and it will distend about two
inches&mdash;an elasticity quite equal to that of any
other orifice of the body. As the anal tissues are
usually the first to be invaded by disease, it is but
natural that the ob­sti­pa­tion or con­sti­pa­tion should
occur right above it&mdash;namely, in the rectum. The
average length of the rectum is about six inches,
and when the disease invades its whole length the
con­sti­pa­tion occurs in the sigmoid flexure and may
thence extend to the colon.</p>

<p>The filling of the intestine with feces and gases
usually occurs just above the diseased portion of
the gut; but at the same time the walls of the
affected part of the canal are more or less coated
with feces, and its abnormal pouches here and there
contain more or less liquefied or dried feces. A
diseased canal cannot expel all of its contents, since
its normal expulsive power is gone. Some of the
feces somehow or other gets down and out, but
a larger portion inevitably remains. It is for this
reason that a diseased intestine always reminds one
of the Augean stable. It is simply marvelous that
the human body continues as a living organism
with so much filth and bacterial poison stored in
its alimentary canal, and the vaults that result
from abnormal pressure during periods of fecal
impaction (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_4">4</a>).</p>

<p>When the inflammatory process extends up the<span class="pagenum" title="14"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a></span>
rectum and at the same time into the spongy, fatty,
or areolar tissue under the mucous membrane (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_1">1</a>, 3–3),
thence to the muscular and serous layers
(Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_1">1</a>, 2–1), or through the four layers of tissue
comprising its wall, we have a more marked and
serious occlusion (closing) of the organ than when
only the mucous membrane was affected. When
muscular tissue is inflamed, its tendency is to contract
and become solidified by an adhesive inflammatory
product secreted between the circular and
longitudinal muscular fibres (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_1">1</a>, 7, and Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_7">7</a>).
Often the circular or sphincter muscles forming the
anal canal have to be distended to bring about a
more normal vent. The same pathological conditions
that occasion contraction of the anal bore or
caliber occur, more or less, as far up the gut as the
disease has advanced.</p>

<p>In a normal state of the lower bowel the sigmoid
flexure passes its contents into the rectum, and the
desire to defecate is reported&mdash;that is, the impulse
to stool becomes more or less urgent until it is performed.
But when all four coats of the anus and
rectum are diseased, with perhaps a portion of the
sigmoid flexure also, it is very difficult for the healthy
portion of the sigmoid flexure and the colon to discharge
their contents into the rectum; consequently
no call, impulse, or desire reaches the mind. Constipation
will then ensue, for the stool, not being called
for, is not performed. Every demand of a healthy
portion of the intestine is answered by increased
contraction of the muscles of the diseased portion<span class="pagenum" title="15"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a></span>
of the rectum. While the war between the healthy
and the diseased sections of the bowels goes on,
the victim naturally concludes that there is no occasion
or demand for defecation, and he attends to
other affairs, ignorant of the fact that he is thus
making a fatal mistake.</p>

<p>The first condition that ensues is the tendency of
the rectum to fill unduly with feces and gases, impelling
the victim to “strain” in order to force the
feces through the constricted anal canal. After a
while the sigmoid flexure and colon will fill unduly,
and then the victim will form the habit of waiting for
the feces to descend, and of straining to expel what
little manages to escape through the diseased gut.</p>

<p>A portion of the imprisoned feces in the healthy
section of the intestine sometimes, at an unguarded
moment, manages to distribute itself along the
length of the diseased and constricted canal, where
it is retained indefinitely, increasing the local irritation.
And when the fecal mass accumulates sufficiently
in both the healthy and the diseased portions
of the intestines to set up a vigorous excitement,
the victim may, by the aid of his waiting and straining
habit (which habit, by the way, only torments
and bruises the chronically diseased organs), bring
on some sort of evacuation. In the early history
of the disease this habit may serve for a time; but,
as the disease progresses, the “laxative” habit is
formed, which, in turn, settles into a chronic “drug”
habit for all sorts and conditions of gastro-intestinal
and other ills, which inevitably ensue. As the ravages<span class="pagenum" title="16"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a></span>
of chronic inflammation of the anus and rectum
increase, the symptoms rapidly multiply, till finally
the victim, in desperation, feels that he must find
additional sources of relief&mdash;and, among other habits,
he forms the “diet” habit.</p>

<p>The order of abnormal habits brought into existence
by ulcerative inflammation of the anus, rectum,
and colon is about as follows: (1) the habit of unduly
retaining the feces in the rectum; (2) the
habit of straining at stool; (3) the habit of unduly
retaining the feces in the sigmoid flexure; (4) the
habit of resorting to the use of purgatives, pepsin,
and other drugs; (5) the chronic “physic” habit;
(6) the foolish “diet” habit; (7) the gastro-intestinal
neurasthenic habit; (8) the health-resort
habit; (9) the habit of trying desperately to appear
agreeable while feeling really ill; (10) the habit of
blaming the liver for all direful feelings, physical
and mental.</p>

<p>It is but natural that the lower portion of the
rectal and anal structures should be affected more
severely than any other portion of the intestines
by the ulcerative, inflammatory process. The
sphincter muscles are very strong, as a rule, and
fill their office only too well when the anal and
rectal canals are in a diseased state, for they effectually
prevent the contents from escaping. Often
their contraction or stricture is so great that their
expansion is limited to from one-fourth to one-half
an inch. This virtually permanent closure of the
anal vent naturally results in an accumu­la­tion of<span class="pagenum" title="17"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a></span>
feces just above it, or in the lower portion of the
rectum, which accounts for the dilatation, stretching,
or ballooning of the anal and rectal tissues immediately
above
these muscles, as
shown in Fig.&nbsp;4.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<a id="Fig_4"></a>
<img src="images/i_p017.jpg" width="275" height="310" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p class="tac pb05"><span class="smcap">Fig. 4.</span></p>

<p>1, The dotted lines indicate the normal direction
of the anus and rectum; 2, 4, the cavities
or pouch formed by dilatation or ballooning
from the storage of impacted feces; 3, a probe
bent at right angles, and introduced through
a speculum, to ascertain the depth of the
pouch, which is frequently found to be two
and a half inches.</p></div>
</div>

<p>In not a few
cases where dilatation
of the rectum
exists, the
upper half or
more of the anal
canal is also dilated,
leaving an
anal canal only
an eighth of an
inch in length in
some cases; in
other cases, perhaps
half an inch
to an inch.</p>

<p>Similar dilatation
of the sigmoid
flexure occurs as the result of the severe contraction
of the upper half of the rectum, and especially
at the bend shown by Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_6">6</a> and Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_12">12</a>.
This bend forms quite a sphincter for the normal
receptacle&mdash;the sigmoid flexure. Here also prolapse,
distention, and dislocation of the sigmoid

prolapse from disease and abuse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="18"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a></span></p>

<p>Piles and itching of the anus are symptoms of
proctitis, or inflammation of the anus and rectum.
Why should we find such dissimilar symptoms proceeding
from the same cause? The reason is plain
when we consider the results following chronic inflammation
of the mucous membrane of the anus
and rectum and the deeper tissues. Those who
suffer from catarrh of this membrane are familiar
with the discharge of mucus that appears from
time to time during the progress of the inflammation.
But, as the inflammation penetrates the mucous
membrane and the underlying tissues of the
anus and rectum, the escape of the inflammatory
product is prevented; and this imprisoned fluid
must either be absorbed by the system or retained
in reservoirs or in channels wherever the least resistance
is offered to its invasion.</p>

<p>The mucous membrane of the anus and rectum
is loosely attached to the subjacent parts by areolar
tissue (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_1">1</a>, 3–3), which is sufficiently lax to
allow an expansion of two inches; and in a puckered
or contracted state the membrane is thrown
into folds, or into shallow or deep wrinkles. The
loose areolar attachment and folds of various depths
afford space for lodgment of the inflammatory discharge,
which channels its way down along the
folds through the areolar tissue under the mucous
membrane to that of the integument, and so on for
a distance of a foot or more from the anus in some
cases.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />

<span class="smcap">The Formation of Channels, Piles, and
Fistulas.</span></h2>


<p>Should channels, of varying length and numbers,
form early in the development of proctitis,
the sufferer is usually found to be free from
piles, or hemorrhoids, for the reason that the channels
have afforded an outlet to the inflammatory
product. The formation of lengthy channels also
prevents to a great extent the development of
skinny tabs round about the integument of the
anus. This is some compensation to the sufferer
for the labor of scratching and for enduring the
painful itching so often present. Some suffer only
from pain along the channels themselves, while
others experience a slight disturbance of the nervous
system; yet all must be more or less poisoned
from the absorption of so large an amount of the
contents of the channels and cavities.</p>

<p>In the cavities and along the channels the areolar
tissue is of a mahogany color, and no channel
is traced to its end so long as the tissues present a
bruised, inflamed appearance. In some cases the
inflammatory product has destroyed the areolar
tissue attached to the integument at and near the
anus, frequently to the extent of leaving a hollow<span class="pagenum" title="20"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a></span>
space or cavity of surprising dimensions. I have
met only a few cases in which the channels were
opened by pus forming in them. Those that are
very shallow, the walls being friable, may break
and form a fissure of the anus; or a little anal fistula
may arise from a slight suppuration at its end
in the integument near the anus.</p>

<p>In cases where the channels are few and short,
whether itching be present or not, the pile tumors
are likewise few and of moderate size, demonstrating
the intimate relation of the aggravation of
either of the symptoms or the moderation of both
in the same case. Very frequently pile tumors
have channels extending from them to the junction
of the mucous membrane and integument of the
anus, or even under the integument about the
anus, forming rugæ, or tabs.</p>

<p>The number and size of pile tumors would seem
to depend on how completely the inflammatory
product is imprisoned in the tissues in what is
termed the “pile-bearing” region. Often the treatment
of piles, or hemorrhoids, aids very much in the
cure of itching at the anus&mdash;by destroying a part
of the channels involved in the pile structures in
the mucous membrane of the lower end of the rectum
and extending along under the anal membrane
and the integument of the anus.</p>

<p>The meshes and layers of the mucous membrane,
as well as the space occupied by the areolar tissue,
are stretched or pouched by the inflammatory
product.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="21"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a></span></p>

<p>My observation forces me to conclude that the
inflammatory product imprisoned in the areolar
meshes, between the mucous membrane and the
muscular layers, is the principal factor in forming
piles and the channels so often found in the same
region. Of course, obstructed circulation, congested
veins, capillaries, and arterioles, and a more
or less apparent varicose condition, increase the
size of the pile tumors and the general thickness
of the mucous membrane over the region affected
by the disease.</p>

<p>The process occasioning the separation of the
mucous membrane from its areolar attachment or
bed often extends the whole length of the rectum,
giving the mucous membrane the loose and raised
appearance that a piece of thin silk would have if
laid on over that surface. The fatty or areolar
tissue under the skin about the anus suffers likewise
by being destroyed, leaving a hollow cavity
or a large channel of great length under the skin.
The separation of the mucous membrane and integument
about the anus from their areolar attachment
permits of prolapse of the mucous membrane
and integument that form the anal canal and skin
around the orifice.</p>

<p>It would seem that the channels, pile sacs, and
cavities serve as temporary reservoirs for the inflammatory
product, a portion of which the system
absorbs and another portion of which escapes
through the mucous membrane and integument.
In escaping in this way it occasions itching and<span class="pagenum" title="22"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a></span>
pain. The itching or soreness does not in all cases
extend throughout the whole length of the channel.
A few inches of the channel farthest from its origin
may be the seat of the greatest disturbance, and the
sufferer and physician alike are usually unaware
that the source of the trouble is in the tissues of
the anus and rectum.</p>

<p>The marked improvement in the health of those
that have been cured of both the morbid condition
produced by the inflammatory product and the
cause of that condition is evidence that the general
vitality of the system had been greatly lowered,
even though the most annoying of the symptoms,
such as piles, itching, or acute pain, had not been
present. The lack of annoyance along the channel
for a certain period may be due to a limited production,
or to a rapid absorption of the inflammatory
product by the system.</p>

<p>Proctitis and the attendant symptoms just described
have been overlooked by the medical
profession. Physicians have confined their attention
to two symptoms&mdash;piles and fistula. After
undergoing a surgical operation for these, the patient
is considered cured. What ignorance, or
rather short-sightedness, to remove only the annoying
symptom, and then to pronounce the patient
healed! Let me ask my professional brethren why
they do not concern themselves with the underlying
<i>cause</i> of the symptom or symptoms, and whether
they suppose this cause is going out of business.
Surely it is a grave mistake to concern one’s self<span class="pagenum" title="23"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a></span>
with the leading symptom merely&mdash;to remove that,
and to leave its cause intact. When the disease-producing
cause remains to generate its poisonous
effects in the system, opportunities exist for further
symptoms to develop.</p>

<p>The system may be already depleted of vitality,
and the harsh treatment for the purpose of removing
a mere symptom may only make the sufferer’s
condition more deplorable&mdash;if it does not indeed
cause death.</p>

<p>There are other symptoms of proctitis than piles
and fistula, which remain after the conventional
surgical operation for their removal. Obstipation
and con­sti­pa­tion are usually symptoms of proctitis,
and will persist until the inflammation in the upper
half of the rectum and sometimes in a portion of
the sigmoid flexure is cured.</p>

<p>The victim of proctitis has two marked sources
of poisoning of the system: one proceeding from
the absorption of the inflammatory product, and the
other from undue retention of the waste matter of
the body that should pass out by the lower bowel.</p>

<p>Inflammation of a mucous membrane causes
structural changes in the tissues involved in the
morbid process, and not infrequently it becomes the
seat of a malignant disease.</p>

<p>The reader may be familiar with the white, loose,
alveolar (honeycomb-like) network of elastic tissue
(called fat) just under the skin and mucous membrane.

</div>

<p>The abdominal and pelvic organs are cushioned<span class="pagenum" title="24"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a></span>
or held in place somewhat by the network of fatty
tissue that surrounds them, and the rectum is no
exception to the rule. The outer or serous wall is
surrounded by an abundance of loose areolar tissue,<span class="pagenum" title="25"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a></span>
which is divided into cellular spaces. When this
tissue also is invaded by inflammation, the condition
is spoken of as peri­proc­titis; and we have a
result somewhat similar to that which occurs in the
areolar tissue just under the mucous membrane and
integument, as previously described.</p>

<p>As the inflammatory product is discharged into
this spongy or fatty connective tissue it is slowly
forced in some direction, which is naturally downward,
if not too much obstructed by firm tissue;
at all events, it follows the line of least resistance
and forms usually quite a large channel and several
cavities along its course. The channel may begin
at an elevation of four or more inches on the outside
of the rectum (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_5">5</a>). Should it form in
front of the rectum, the seminal vesicles (15) and
the prostate gland (16) would suffer greatly by its
presence.</p>

<p>As the inflammatory process burrows its way
downward, it finally reaches the soft fatty connective
tissue under the skin. It then continues along
this in one or more directions for a distance of two
or more inches. Several of these long, large pus-less
channels may exist for many years, or for a
lifetime, without sufficient evidence of their existence
along their route accurately to locate them.
Itching, pain, and color of the skin often indicate
the presence of such a channel under the integument.
The author has frequently found large
channels extending up along the outer rectal wall
for four inches, and extending out into the deep<span class="pagenum" title="26"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a></span>
tissues of the buttocks in various directions, without
making their presence and ravages known to
the victim.</p>

<p>Such numerous pathological conditions have led
the author to conclude that an abscess just under
the skin and the discharge of pus are merely incidents
in the history of such maladies. Think of it:
your body may be bored with channels or holes of
varying diameters and lengths, while you yourself
may be ignorant of what is occurring! The mucous
membrane may be lifted from the connective
tissue for the whole length of the rectum, and the
skin about the anus may also be in this condition.
You know that your health is not good, but you
are ignorant of the cause. The formation of pus
at some period of the channel’s inroads, or of an
abscess, would seem a kindly act of Nature, for the
presence of so serious a disturber to health would
thus become known.</p>

<p>I have not overdrawn this picture of peri­proc­titis
and of submucous tissue channels. The victims
could scarcely be worse off than they are. I want
boys and girls, young men and young women, to
learn the facts concerning the local dangers of
proctitis; for, when they once realize the seriousness
of this disease because of its many grave
symptoms, they will give it proper attention before
these effects manifest themselves. You cannot
neglect so important a portion of your body as the
anus and rectum and not seriously endanger the
organs that lie close to them. No wonder so many<span class="pagenum" title="27"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a></span>
men are troubled with inflammation and induration
of the prostate gland. The percentage of such
cases would be greatly reduced were proctitis and
peri­proc­titis denied the existence they now enjoy
for years, and often for a lifetime.</p>

<p>In view of all that has been advanced concerning
these local pathological conditions, is it strange
that almost everybody is con­sti­pated, and that we
need some simple sovereign aid to further the
scientific treatment of the physician&mdash;an aid such
as the enema has proved to be?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />

<span class="smcap">Undue Retention of Gas and Feces in the
Sigmoid Flexure.</span></h2>


<p>In the previous chapters attention was called especially
to the lower portion of the rectum and
the anus. In this chapter we will consider the sigmoid
flexure, which, when diseased, is often dilated,
dislocated, and depressed, a pathological condition
somewhat similar to that found in the lower portion
of the rectum and the anus.</p>

<p>The illustration on page&nbsp;29 shows the normal
relations of the rectum and the sigmoid flexure;
also the whole colon. 7 marks the beginning of
the sigmoid flexure, and 6 its upper end. The
reader will note the four sharp curves or flexures
of this organ,&mdash;from 6 to 7,&mdash;which forms in health
a normal and most convenient receptacle for feces,
and which, like the bladder, can be emptied at
regular intervals.</p>

<p>Unless the system were able in some way to
eliminate the waste and poisonous matter it had
generated within six hours, it would fatally poison
itself.</p>

<p>Those internal ventilators, the lungs, and those
external ducts, the pores, are constantly at work<span class="pagenum" title="29"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a></span>
purifying the body; and they are actively assisted
by the kidneys and the bladder. Observation extending
over many years of practice induces me to
believe that among those
who suffer from chronic
con­sti­pa­tion two-thirds
to three-fourths of the
fecal mass is taken into
the system and eliminated
by the kidneys,
mucous membrane, and
skin. Diseases of the
above organs are numerous
and seemingly incurable
from the fact
that their common cause
has not been discovered
and treated properly.
Were it not for these
organs steadily at work,
the labor of the bowels
would be of little avail.
But while the importance
of the former cannot
be ignored, it must be conceded that the most
important of all the eliminating organs are the
bowels, for their function is to discharge not only
the waste solids but also a great amount of waste
liquids and gases as well.</p>

<p>Undue fermentation of the ingesta (the aliment

or less virulence; it must therefore be obvious
that a clean intestinal canal is necessary after every
meal to further the normal digestive process.</p>

<p>Very often the outlet of the sigmoid flexure is obstructed.
Figures
6 and 7 are
shown to make
the cause of this
obstruction
more clear. In
Figure 7 we see
the longitudinal
and transverse
fibers that form
the wall of the
rectum. In all
cases of chronic
ob­sti­pa­tion, the
muscular structure
of the anus,
rectum, and frequently
of a
portion of the
sigmoid flexure
is invaded with
chronic inflammation of a very severe and serious
character.</p>

</div>

<p>What is the result of this inflammation? Self-evidently
contraction of the muscular structure, as
you would quickly enough discover were one of
your hands or arms inflamed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="31"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a></span></p>

<p>Though constant attention should be given to
the much more important organ, the rectum, practically
none is given it. “Out of sight, out of
mind.”</p>

<p>Again, no doctor would diagnose an inflamed
limb as paralysis, atony, etc., and dose the victim
with nux vomica, tonics, physic, etc., in the hope
of thereby healing it. Yet, with singular fatuity,
this absurd diagnosis and treatment is given when
the lower bowel is invaded with chronic inflammation.</p>

<p>Let the common-sense reader inform himself
concerning his organism. Let him remember that
he has within muscular organs that demand exactly
the same attention when diseased as those without.
This fact is especially important for the sufferer
from con­sti­pa­tion or semi-con­sti­pa­tion to know.</p>

<p>Were the anus, rectum, and sigmoid flexure one
continuous straight tube, the muscular action in the
process of defecation would not be as complex as
it is, since then the feces would drop right down
and out. But these parts have so many curves and
angles that when disease invades their interior they
accentuate their folds and valves by contracting and
do not readily respond to the nerve demand for
complex, muscular, snakelike movements, when
evacuation is desired. In this unreadiness to respond
they cast into confusion all the functions of the
whole complicated organism, all parts of which are
necessarily interdependent. A wise provision of
Mother Nature are these curves, angles, and valves,<span class="pagenum" title="32"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a></span>
for they prevent the sudden dropping of the contents
of the colon down to the anal orifice&mdash;a possibility
that would greatly embarrass us during
social and business hours.</p>

<p>The accompanying figure shows the rectum dissected
at its upper end from the sigmoid
flexure. This portion of the
rectum is smaller than the lower
two-thirds of the organ. Now, it
is this lessened diameter of the gut
that is an aid to the sigmoid flexure
in its capacity as a receptacle,
but a most decided hindrance when
it is diseased&mdash;since it will positively
inhibit the passage of feces
and gases, thereby occasioning a
distention of the sigmoid flexure
(ob­sti­pa­tion) because of a detention
of the contents, which then weights
the flexure down upon the rectum.
Thus we see exemplified how an
aid may turn into a hindrance, as
we already have observed, in an
unduly contracted anal vent.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 125px;">
<a id="Fig_8"></a>

<div class="caption"><p class="tac"><span class="smcap">Fig. 8.</span></p></div>
</div>

<p>The <i>rectum</i> is not straight, as the word itself
would indicate, but curves to the right, then back
well on to the spine, and then forward to the anus,
which turns slightly backward from the lower anterior
portion of the rectum.</p>

<p>When these muscular-tube organs are invaded
by disease, these very curves, valves, and bends of<span class="pagenum" title="33"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a></span>
anus, rectum, and sigmoid flexure are responsible
for at least nine-tenths of the ills that affect humanity
from the cradle to the grave&mdash;ills directly
due to self-poisoning, technically known as auto-infection
and auto-intoxication, the fashionable
name of which is neurasthenia: a weakening of involuntary
and voluntary nervous systems through
lack of vent from irritating poisons, flatulency, and
of course defective metabolism or nutrition. A
better name would be <i>vaso-motor neurasthenia</i>.</p>

<p>After these anatomical and physiological points
have been noted, it is to be hoped that the reader
has grasped the idea of how easily this portion of
the bowels, when diseased, can prevent the normal
descent of the feces and gases accumulated just
above the diseased portion of the gut. It should
also be easy to understand how a portion of the
unduly retained feces may pass out, but in so doing
be the cause of increased irritation and consequent
contraction of the muscular tube, preventing thus
any further passage of feces from its receptacle.
Usually a portion of the escaping feces is caught
and held in the rectum itself, converting the rectum
into a receptacle.</p>

<p>It is just here that the practical application of
the principles deduced must come in. Let my professional
brethren as well as all victims of bowel
disease consider the following question, and then
all will be clear: Since normal feces contain about
75 per cent. water, is there any harm, nay, is there
not decided benefit, in suddenly liquefying the imprisoned<span class="pagenum" title="34"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34"></a></span>
mass to, say, 99 per cent.&mdash;whether disease
exist or not?</p>

<p>When disease exists we simply desire to open
the contracted or obstructed canal. What can be
better, in a therapeutic line, than the kindly distending
influence of warm water to overcome the
spasmodic closure of the diseased tube? In addition
to the gentle dilatation the injected water occasions,
the water creates or calls into activity the
lost nervous impulse to evacuate, which impulse is
a step toward the restoration of the lost normality.</p>

<p>Under the benignant influence of the water injected
in the large intestine there comes a desire
to expel it, which, when responded to, carries with
it the feces so long imprisoned, and at the same
time divests the walls of the intestine of the inevitable
incrustations.</p>

<p>Thus, with purifying water, the foul pool is
emptied, and the parts are cleansed so thoroughly
that nothing is left to vex the inflamed tissue.</p>

<p>Is there any sane person that can offer one valid
objection to the use of depuratory enemas in cases
in which the normal function of the bowels is
lost through abnormal changes brought about by
chronic disease?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />

<span class="smcap">Rebellion of our outraged Internal
Economy.</span></h2>


<p>The small intestine is that portion of the alimentary
canal which begins at the stomach and
ends at the large intestine. Its usual length is
twenty feet. The diameter, which at the upper
portion (duodenum) is two inches, gradually becomes
less, until at the lower end it is but one
inch.</p>

<p>Now, the length of the inner coat of this small
intestine&mdash;the mucous membrane&mdash;is about <i>double</i>
that of the intestine itself. Think of wearing a
coat twice as long as yourself! How do you think
this is accomplished in the case of the muscular
tube under con­sid­er­ation? Well, Nature, having
a most peculiar function to perform, has thrown
this mucous coat or tube into a thousand folds (valvulæ
conniventes, or “winking valves”). These
folds form valves, occupying from one-third to one-half
the circum­ference of the bowel. The greatest
width of each fold is at the center, where it measures
from a quarter to half an inch. Over this
great expanse of mucous membrane we find studded
ten million five hundred thousand intestinal<span class="pagenum" title="36"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a></span>
villi, whose office it is to absorb the food substances
in their passage through the canal.</p>

vent of the intestinal
sewer. It is called
the colon&mdash;the ascending,
transverse,
and descending colon.
It is about five
feet in length. Its
diameter is the greatest
at the cæcum,
where it measures,
when moderately distended,
two and a half
to three and a half
inches. Beyond the
cæcum the diameter
is one and two-thirds
to two and two-thirds
inches, the smallest
part being at the upper end of the rectum.</p>

<p>The muscular move­ments of the large in­tes­tine
are much more limit­ed in number and range than
those of the small in­tes­tines. The area of its mucous
mem­brane is also much less, not­with­stand­ing
the fact that it is thrown into sac­cu­lated pouches,
or sac­culi, by the con­trac­tion of the lon­gi­tu­din­al
mus­cu­lar bands of the bowel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="38"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a></span></p>

<p>Consider this tube, for it is really unique. Note
the longitudinal muscular bands (Figs.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_12">12</a> and <a href="#Fig_13">13</a>).
We find this tube to be five feet long when the
surface made by the
circular bands is
measured, and four
feet long when that
made by the longitudinal
bands is
measured. Now, the
four feet of surface
must of course contract
the five feet.
Well, in the tube under
con­sid­er­ation,
the musculo-areolo
mucous tube is
thrown into circular
puckerings in short
sections, between
which are deep transverse
creases, each bounded by prominent bulges.
(Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_13">13</a>.) An inspection of the bore of the tube
shows a sharp ridge corresponding to each depression
of the outer surface, and a large recess collocated
with each external protrusion. This external
and internal appearance of the large intestine reminds
one somewhat of the flexible hard-rubber
tubing used as a conduit for electric wire in houses.</p>

<p>I have given this somewhat lengthy <i>résumé</i> in
order to enable
the reader to
appreciate a
most pertinent
question.</p>

<p>Let us see
what we have
found: The
small in­tes­tine,
with its mani­fold
folds and
its nu­mer­ous
pockets, made
by the forty
feet of mucous mem­brane; the bends and curves
in the five feet of the large in­tes­tine, with its
nu­mer­ous dams and pools; and, lastly, the abnormal
res­er­voirs for feces, liquids, and gases.</p>

<p>Finding this, the question inevitably is, What is
the best agent for cleansing this marvelously sensitive
canal, twenty-five feet long, whose mucous
membrane extends forty-five feet? No one would
think of taking, if he could, the foul sewer in his
hands, and shaking it, fold upon fold, with the faint
yet fond hope of sterilizing it. How can any mode
of physical culture meet the requirements for effecting
a cure of ulcerative proctitis and colitis, to say<span class="pagenum" title="41"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a></span>
nothing about keeping the bowels sweet and clean?
Chronic, subacute, and acute inflammation, accompanied
with ulceration, located in any part of the
body, requires rest to
overcome the fever and
congestion. Muscular
exercise irritates and
inflames the diseased
parts.</p>

<p>Another form of
“physical culture”
would put into the bowels
all sorts of stuff that
cannot be digested,
such as bran, crushed
seeds, shells, raw food,
etc., that set up excessive
muscular action
and secretion of mucus
as the improper
stuff passes down and
out. In the sacred
name of hygiene, this
new cathartic remedy
is prescribed and taken.
Seeking relief from the
painful effects, the patient finds that these “remedies”
make the disease and its symptoms worse.
Hygienic fool-killers are, like the poor, always with
us.</p>

</div>

<p>You are aware of the irritation that a grain of<span class="pagenum" title="42"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a></span>
sand will set up when it comes in contact with the
mucous membrane of the eye. Then can you not
realize that you will torment the forty-five feet of
intestinal mucous membrane with like indigestible
stuff? It is estimated that ten per cent. of the
really suitable food is residue matter with which
the digestive tract has to deal and get rid of with
as much economy and as little friction as possible.
Then why increase this residue twenty or fifty per
cent.?</p>

<p>More than nine-tenths of the human race have
been content to depend on comparatively violent
excitants, such as drugs, coarse food, and muscular
exercise, etc., to relieve the bowels of the feces,
liquids, and gases of a most foul character&mdash;the
foulness due to putrid fermentation and undue retention.</p>

<p>When will these prescribers and partakers ever
learn that bile bouncers and peristaltic persuaders
have an immense journey before them when they
start to remove the foul accumu­la­tion of feces from
the sigmoid flexure and ballooned rectum? For,
be it remembered, the normal receptacle for feces
is twenty-four feet four inches from the stomach,
and the abnormal receptacle twenty-four feet eleven
inches&mdash;within two inches of the vent of the body!</p>

<p>Surely quite a degree of mental con­sti­pa­tion
must have existed in both the prescribers and the
partakers to think such thick and dense thoughts
as are represented by these bouncers and persuaders.
So you would <i>cleanse</i> the bowels with<span class="pagenum" title="43"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a></span>
such unclean, poisonous, and irritating things!
What amazing hope born of ignorance! Outraged
Nature cries: “How long! how long! how long
will my ‘inards’ be so abused in the name of cleanliness
and yet remain so unclean? Ye benighted
mortals, if ye would listen to me, your Mother, I
would give ye a pure and wholesome prescription,
for I would prescribe equal parts of enlightenment
and water well mixed, and advise ye to take a portion
of it fore and a portion of it aft, per os (mouth)
and per anus. Thus and thus alone would I prescribe
for ye; such and such alone is the way for
ye to do; purify to cure, or cure by purifying.”</p>

<p>Constipation must not continue, for it means not
only the clogging up of the large intestine with the
foul sewage of the system, but also the drying of
that sewage, which latter process implies the absorption
of poison. Now that you are in this condition,
Medicus steps up and prescribes a cathartic
mixed with belladonna or opium, or both. These
latter are meant to quiet the mournful cry of outraged
Nature when the cathartic invades its sacred
precincts. And it may be noted, by the way, that
though belladonna, atropine, morphia, etc., tend to
dry up the secretions of the mucous membrane and
make matters worse by making them still more
arid, still the action of the cathartic is usually so
powerful that after the free fight with the pain
soothers it triumphs, and produces a free flow of
watery secretion into the dried, impacted mass of
the bowel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="44"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a></span></p>

<p>Does it not stand to reason that the greater
portion of the liquid in which the feces were dissolved
and had fermented is re-absorbed into the
system? Why should the poor victim of proctitis
and cathartics wonder why he has gout, rheumatism,
and disease of the kidneys, bladder, lungs,
liver, stomach, nerves; why he has neurasthenia,
debility, feebleness, loss of memory, inability to fix
and hold the attention upon a single line of thought,
apprehensions, etc.? His wonder is childish, for
deep in his heart he knows that he poisoned himself.
He knows this, but it seems that he must be
reminded of the fact that there is a better way to
remove the accumulated mass from the large intestine,
and to prevent in future the undue retention
of feces, liquids, and gases in abnormal sacs
or pouches. The way that Nature prescribes is
the resort daily, two or three times, to the enema.</p>

<p>When the injected water reaches the imprisoned
and dried feces, the crust is loosened from its holdings
and the mass is moved toward the exit by the
expulsive effort of the bowels. Previously the
bowels were helpless with their load. As the sudden
flood of water is expelled it carries with it the
inspissated feces; whereupon the subconscious personal
Ego, who is the superintendent of the digestive
apparatus and functions, congratulates himself
on the delightfully refreshing manner in which the
local disturber has been ousted.</p>

<p>Such is the satisfactory decision of the arbitrator&mdash;Enlightened
Nature. No longer need we bow<span class="pagenum" title="45"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a></span>
to Medicus or to any other kind of “cuss,” whether
styled hygiene or physical culture. Arbitration of
this sort makes life worth living.</p>

<p>Now for Nature’s benediction: “May that feeling
of freedom from uncleanliness, internal and
external, be with you constantly, and this double
blessing make your joys flow so fast that in their
rapidity they blend into a sun and radiate from
your rejuvenated physical being.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />

<span class="smcap">Gaseous Obesity and our Roly-polies.</span></h2>


<p>Is there any human being so ignorant that he cannot
understand that when food stuffs in the
gastro-intestinal canal ferment and putrefy they
thereby generate toxic (poisonous) gaseous matter,
volatile fatty acids, and putrid feces; that such
matter, acids, and feces are rapidly absorbed by the
system, and that, if the system does not readily
eliminate them by way of the bowels, kidneys, and
mucous membrane, they will tend to bring on one
or more forms of acute or chronic disease?</p>

<p>Gas is matter in its most rarefied state&mdash;a state
that permits its easy entrance into all the tissues
of the body, where it perverts by its presence and
toxic effect the normal function of all the organs.
Besides its poisonous infection, it distends or bloats
the stomach, bowels, and tissues&mdash;a fact especially
noticeable in the abdominal region, giving the appearance
of corpulency or obesity to many, when
really it is only abdominal ballooning or gaseous
obeseness. Roly-polies&mdash;and there are a great
many of them&mdash;will have their pride greatly hurt
by accounting for their condition in this way, but
the truth must be told and they might as well face<span class="pagenum" title="47"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a></span>
the facts first as last. Gaseous obesity, or borborygmus,
is spoken of popularly as wind in the
stomach and bowels. No wonder the roly-poly is
sensitive on the subject, for this “wind” occasions
rumbling sounds, eructations, and offensive odors&mdash;all
of which are a great annoyance to the sufferer
from dilated, displaced, and unclean digestive
apparatus.</p>

<p>Besides being generated in the system, gases
may be swallowed during the act of eating, in the
form of air (oxygen and nitrogen), and in liquids
containing carbonic acid, sulphuretted hydrogen,
etc.</p>

<p>Micro-organisms swallowed with the food will
occasion fermentation of the contents of the stomach
and bowels, which if unduly retained become excessive,
foul, and toxic&mdash;therefore extremely harmful
to the system.</p>

<p>The gases generated in the stomach are the following:
carbonic acid, hydrogen, hydrochloric, ammonia,
sulphuretted hydrogen, marsh gas, etc.
They are partly absorbed or thrown off by eructations,
or they pass into the duodenum or small
intestine.</p>

<p>Gases are found throughout the small and the
large intestine. These are the result of both the
normal and the abnormal digestive fermentation
and bacterial decomposition of the ingesta or food
stuffs. Some of the gases are passed into the intestines
from the blood by diffusion.</p>

<p>The production of gas is more copious in the<span class="pagenum" title="48"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a></span>
upper portion of the small intestine and becomes
less rapid and abundant as the large intestine is
reached. As formed or found in the intestines,
the gases are: carbonic acid, hydrogen, marsh, ammonia,
nitrogen, sulphuretted hydrogen, and sulphate
of ammonia.</p>

<p>Considering the large amount of abnormal gases
generated in the bowels and which abnormally distend
the abdominal walls for several inches and
press upon the heart and lungs, and considering
the small amount passed out as flatus, their entrance
into the tissues of the body must be very
rapid and harmful.</p>

<p>Stop the habitual putre­fac­tion and mal-digestion,
and then the formation of toxic feces, gases, and
volatile acid will speedily cease. Then the erstwhile
roly-polies will shrink in circum­ference four
or more inches, necessitating the refitting of their
garments to the new and better order of things.</p>

<p>Much has been written about the distention of
the rectum, sigmoid flexure, and colon from the
undue accumulation of feces. The fecal distention
of the gut may extend along the intestine for from
three to nine inches or more, which is a very grave
matter indeed. But why is so much attention given
to a few inches of impacted feces dilating a portion
of the bowel, and none whatever to the prevention
or elimination of gaseous matter that distends the
whole gastro-intestinal canal to such an extent that
the body is tightly inflated and the median parts of
the belly bulge out like a balloon?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="49"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a></span></p>

<p>Cattle raisers are conversant with the gaseous
inflation of their animals, and have to resort to the
knife to puncture the stomach to permit the gas to
escape; otherwise fatal results would soon follow.
Some animals, even, like most human beings, are
intemperate in eating. When they consume too
much grass they suffer from flatulency and colic,
and require drastic treatment.</p>

<p>Rather than let some worthy men and women
die, ought we not at times to adopt the ranchman’s
treatment for flatus? This harsh means, however,
might be avoided by inventive science. Overfed,
con­sti­pated, inflated man, victim of habitual flatulency,
could easily have small gas valves inserted
here and there along his gastro-intestinal canal&mdash;one,
say, to relieve the stomach of toxic gas, another
for the appendix region, and still another in the
hernial region of the abdomen. Suppose overfeeders
were to adopt the gas-valve fad, and discontinue
the habit of using cathartics, soda, charcoal, peppermint,
pepsin, whiskey, etc., as means of relief!
How in the world can a <i>drug</i> aid digestion when
taken into a foul, gaseous, and feces-clogged canal?</p>

<p>A chemist cannot get the definite results he seeks
unless he have the right chemicals and proper vessels.
Just so with the spiritual Ego and his systemic
chemistry of food: he needs a clean and healthy
digestive apparatus for proper assimilation and
elimination. But he gets careless, allows it to get
foul, and then insincerely expresses astonishment
that the chemical combinations are not such as one<span class="pagenum" title="50"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a></span>
could wish or expect. Other chemists, called doctors
or druggists, come along and dose the poor
victim of his own carelessness until they have
ruined his apparatus completely. They have got
to live, of course; and it is their business to see
that he does not escape so long as they can help it.</p>

<p>Sometimes there is a reassertion of common
sense; the poor victim becomes disgusted with
himself and his credulous acceptance of the doctor’s
dictation and his fatuous swilling of the druggist’s
decoctions. He gets tired of chronic ill-health and
bowel troubles, and, lo and behold! he does the
simplest and most sensible thing in the world&mdash;a
thing he ought to have done at the very start, or
before he ever had the least trouble: He thoroughly
washes out his alimentary canal with pure or antiseptic
water. He drinks a lot of pure spring water,
and he flushes his bowels with two or three enemas.
Doctors and drugs are henceforth banished; he
gets well! What a blessing to lose one’s faith in
the magic of drugs and the majesty of doctors!</p>

<p>Few comprehend the baneful effects of flatulency
on the system, the most usual of which are fatigue,
depression, headache, buzzing in the ears, deafness,
vertigo, loss of memory, inability to fix the attention,
disturbance of sight, drowsiness, etc. A continuous
stream of carbonic acid or of hydrogen
directed against muscular tissue will cause paralysis
of the part.</p>

<p>Physicians admit that in certain portions of the
alimentary canal extensive dilatation may occur,<span class="pagenum" title="51"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a></span>
independent of any permanent obstruction, in the
lumen, or bore, of the gut. As a rule, however, victims
of proctitis and colitis suffer from more or less
occlusion of the lumen in the region invaded by
the ulcerative inflammatory process.</p>

<p>Considering that the wall of the abdomen is often
greatly extended by gas within the digestive apparatus,
it is not amiss to assume that this gas may
cause local distention of segments of the gastro-intestinal
canal, sufficient to paralyze or render inoperative
the parts.</p>

<p>Suppose we make a rubber duplicate of the
abdominal walls of the average man, and place
therein rubber duplicates of all the internal vital
organs&mdash;pelvic and abdominal. To hold the
stomach, bowels, and other organs in place, we
fasten them with elastic bands here and there, and
make a generous use of cotton to support the various
parts, which are all connected with many little
circulating tubes, with strings for the greater nerves,
etc. Now let us distend our thin artificial digestive
apparatus with air or gas&mdash;snugly filling the abdominal
space of our model, without tension, however,
or slackness of the various parts, which are
happily adjusted and at rest. Now, be it remembered,
persons suffering from flatulency are more
or less in the predicament of the gluttonous animal
referred to above: the gas will not escape at either
end, however much of an effort it makes, or the
victim may make to help it.</p>

removed and the liver turned up and to the right. The dotted line shows
the normal position of the anterior border of the liver. The arrow points
to the foramen of Winslow. (Gerrish.)</p></div>
</div>

<p>In filling very slowly our thin artificial alimentary<span class="pagenum" title="52"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a></span><span class="pagenum hide" title="53"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a></span>
canal, note the distention along the canal as the
gas accumulates. Then note that the elastic bands
stretch as the various segments of the canal change
location, especially the stomach and portions of the
small intestine and of the colon, etc. The stomach,
small intestine, and colon, as they dilate, shift about
for room. The abdomen is seen to bulge out some
four or more inches while the turmoil is heard going
on inside.</p>

<p>Continue this inflation and our rubber intestinal
tract will display here and there a displacement and
permanent abnormal enlargement of the lumen or
bore. Suppose, further, that our complete model
of the abdominal viscera and wall had tightly
around its outer surface unelastic corsets, skirt
bands, trouser bands, vests, etc., all or any of which
held in or compressed its bulging wall&mdash;what would
happen? Why, something inside would slip out of
place or burst and let all the wind escape, relegating
our creation to the rubbish heap.</p>

<p>Now, when a man loses his wind by the rupture
of a tube, he is said to have expired, and his body
is sent to the crematory&mdash;or ought to be sent there
for sanitary reasons. It would be much more satisfactory,
by the way, to our friends, after our demise,
were our bodies sterilized while they “live.”</p>

<p>I hope I have made it clear that it is a most serious
pathological condition&mdash;inasmuch as it prevents
the normal onward progress of ingesta and feces&mdash;to
permit of the continued existence of an excessively
dilated gastro-intestinal canal, with one or<span class="pagenum" title="54"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a></span>
more of its segments permanently enlarged&mdash;segments
like the stomach, duodenum, cæcum, transverse
colon, sigmoid flexure, rectum, etc.&mdash;and
with pendulous abdomen, sallow and muddy complexion,
etc.</p>

<p>When to this condition is added a general displacement
of the abdominal viscera, or of one or
more of the organs of the abdominal and pelvic
cavities, you have an objective picture of chronic
ill health in all its severity.</p>

<p>Are you sincerely desirous to know how your
friends feel when you greet them? Don’t ask
them the stereotyped question, “How do you
do?” or, if you are a German, “How do you go
it?” or, if you are a Frenchman, “How do you
carry yourself?” But ask them the specific and
sensible question appropriate to our civilized habits:
“How are you and your bowels to-day?” And
at parting it were well to say: “May peace be with
you both&mdash;you and your bowels!”</p>

<p>The spirit of man can torment his personality,
and his personality in turn can vex his spirit.</p>

<p>Few people are aware of the fact that the stomach
and intestines can undergo alteration in position.
Many are familiar with the fact that the kidneys
may be displaced, and are then called “floating
kidneys”; that the liver, pancreas, spleen, and
uterus occasionally go on excursions, causing thereby
considerable and numerous disturbances. And
it is not at all strange that they should, since there
is so much pressure from within, so much pressure<span class="pagenum" title="55"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a></span>
downward, and so much pressure from without&mdash;all
through the requirements of fashion, indulgence,
and ignorance. But the stomach, upper portion
of the duodenum, and small intestine, cæcum,
the ascending colon, and especially the transverse
colon and sigmoid flexure, are susceptible to various
forms of displacement, inhibiting the ready
flow or passage of food stuffs, gases, and feces
from one segment of the digestive apparatus to
another, until the vent is reached.</p>

<p>Reviewing the ground already gone over, we
have found that proctitis, as a rule, is the primary
cause of sigmoiditis and colitis; that these combined
are the cause of con­sti­pa­tion; that this is
the cause of indigestion, flatulency, and distended
alimentary canal, and, as matters go from bad to
worse, of permanent distentions and displacement.
Is it any wonder then that there are so many that
suffer from <i>gastro-intestinal neurasthenia</i>?</p>

<p>Surely our digestive apparatus ought to have as
much attention as a well-regulated house furnace.
In the morning the ashes are dumped and fresh
coal is put on. A similar process is gone through
with at noon and night. Some may run their furnaces
on two meals a day and two dumpings of the
waste material.</p>

<p>When a boy puts a penny into a slot machine

Why should he give a thought where his penny

put food stuff, and other stuff as well, into the
upper slot of his machine, for he gets immediately
satisfaction thereby. But he is like the boy; he
doesn’t care a fig what becomes of the stuff so long
as it doesn’t annoy him too much. Eventually the
machine refuses to work, and seems unable to deliver
the goods at the other end; something has
become clogged or out of gear. Let me advise
the reader at least to keep the passage clear by
dumping the systemic furnace twice or thrice daily&mdash;using
the enema to effect the result.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />

<span class="smcap">Irrigation of the Assimilative and Eliminative
Organs.</span></h2>


<p>The habits of people in general do not seem so
bad when one considers the average individual’s
limitations as to knowledge and thought. The
fact is that most people don’t know, don’t think,
and hence don’t care. Let them read more science,
think more sensibly, and act more seriously; then
their habits will be more satisfactory.</p>

<p>The alimentary receptacle&mdash;the stomach or vat
in which foods and liquids are received and mixed&mdash;is
habitually converted by many persons into a
chemical retort for all sorts of drugs and remedies,
with the view of reaching and relieving the ills of
the various organs of the body, from dandruff to
corns. The writer believes that he can give more
and better reasons for his confidence in the therapeutic
value of remedies than most other physicians,
but he wishes to emphasize here the transcendent
importance of common sense in their administration.
Before and above all else, however, what is
wanted is a clean gastro-intestinal canal; and his
claim is that water, properly used, is the best agent
to effect that cleansing. On a par with this canal
in importance are the eliminative tissues and organs<span class="pagenum" title="58"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a></span>
of the system: the kidneys, mucous membrane, and
skin. What therapeutic agent, properly used, is
better than water? After all the assimilative and
eliminative organs and tissues have been thoroughly
rinsed with pure, soft water, then, if it be still necessary
to administer a chemical agent, one may be
selected that will, with these organs and tissues in
better condition, work wonders. If you are so
foolish as to allow yourself to become foul from
head to foot, cleanse yourself with water before
resorting to chemical aids.</p>

<p>Somehow or other the mass of even intelligent
people, not to speak of the great mass of the ignorant,
and I may add even my co-workers in the
healing art, are not aware of the supreme want and
worth of water for internal and external therapeutic
purposes; they do not realize how the stomach,
the bowels, and the kidneys cry for it in their neglected
and infected condition.</p>

<p>The stomach serves as a convenient receptacle
to dump things into after the palate has been entertained
and pleased&mdash;and about everything is swallowed
but pure, soft water. As a rule the stomach
takes very kindly to water. It is, moreover, not so
piggish as to absorb it all and leave its surface in a
foul condition, covered with ropy, slimy products
of imperfect digestion. Immediately after deglutition
of water, the stomach does just what it ought
to do: its muscles contract and dump the contents
of the stomach into the duodenum, where the principal
act of digestion is accomplished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="59"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a></span></p>

<p>As its name implies, the stomach (stow-make) is
a receptacle made for the purpose of storing stuffs
for nutrition. Here they are mixed and broken up
somewhat, and then deposited in the second or real
digestive apparatus&mdash;the duodenum. This latter
organ requires water and organic fluids in liberal
quantities for its digestive operations. Both organs
need cleansing after they have finished their work,
and the digestive and assimilative vessels require
water, not only to convey the building material to
their harbors, but also to eliminate effectually the
worn-out tissues and the residuals of the digestive
process.</p>

<p>It has been said that were man to discover heaven
(a clean and healthy locality) he would at once
convert it into a hell (a vile and filthy one). Man
is possessed of an organism of whose constituent
elements water forms over eighty per cent. The
alvine discharges ought to contain the same percentage
of water, if not more. The mucous membrane
and skin, to be kept clean, soft, fresh, plump,
moist, and free from odors, require their appropriate
irrigation. Man may keep himself clean, both
inside and out, by irrigating himself before each
meal daily. The well-watered and well-washed
body and brain constitute a heaven on earth for
the indwelling spirit that needs these for its manifestation.</p>

</div>

<p>It does seem sometimes that man in his ignorance
gets nothing right except to walk forward instead
of backward. Even so, most likely he walked on<span class="pagenum" title="60"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a></span>
all fours for ages, judging from his progress to
date, before he learned to walk on his hind legs.
To-day we find him self-poisoned, auto-intoxicated,
a gastro-intestinal neurasthenic. His bowels are
filled and stretched with ancient feces and gases,
and his stomach is burdened with undigested food
and tenacious mucus.</p>

<p>The average man’s scanty excreta from the
bowels are dry, hard, lumpy, and foul, exhaling a
noxious odor; and these excretions may be passed
once a day, or once in two or three days, or with
some persons too often, should diarrhea supervene.
Two-thirds to three-fourths of the fecal mass is absorbed
by the system every day; and this absorption
is accompanied more or less constantly by
symptoms of indigestion, biliousness, uric acid,
and many other distressful conditions.</p>

<p>His breath and the exhalations of a garbage-can
are much alike; in fact they are twins, the only difference
between the human and metallic receptacles
being that one is capable of walking and the other
is not. Both manifest the same conditions.</p>

<p>His mucous membrane is covered more or less
with catarrhal discharges, which result in granulated
deposits, especially near the orifices. The
skin is often sallow, dry, yellow, scaly, flabby.
The hair is dry, non-oily, with a scaly scalp, and
often there is a loss or total lack of hair. The
teeth are decayed, the gums are found to recede,
and the eyes, muscles, joints, etc., are more or less
affected by calcareous deposits.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="61"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a></span></p>

<p>Man is seldom or never in a normal physiological
condition. He is either obese or emaciated and
lean. Most bodies are anemic and ill-conditioned,
a prey to several ailments. Of course, civilized
man uses drugs; he would not be civilized were he
not to use on occasion a stimulant, tonic, sedative,
narcotic, etc., and he has to keep in continual touch
with a doctor, to take care of him by prescribing
special diet, fasts, exercise, and what not for his
numerous bodily infirmities. Generally these prescriptions
are ineffective and leave him physically
weaker and financially poorer, with the barren consolation
that he has really tried everything under
heaven that the wisest knew or that money could
buy. Yes, indeed, he tries everything: everything
but <i>water</i>&mdash;pure, soft, spring or distilled
water. He never&mdash;like the flirt&mdash;“thought of
such a thing”! Very few “humanals” think
it worth while to irrigate themselves inside and
out.</p>

<p>Victims of semi-ignorance, too, get things most
abominably mixed. They are often half wrong
and half right; hence they never enjoy good,
sound, robust health and its blessings. Physiologically,
these people are what old-time pastors used
to describe as lukewarm&mdash;neither hot nor cold,
neither good nor bad, neither dirty nor clean,
neither fish nor fowl, neither one thing nor another.
So we find them also complaining and looking for
the fountain of health and strength, but not looking
very anxiously&mdash;they are not interested enough in<span class="pagenum" title="62"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a></span>
the matter. Whenever they possess an equal
mixture of ignorance and laziness, there is not
much hope for
them.</p>

<p>Note the position
of the stomach in
health, and how, by
slight muscular action,
it can free itself
of its contents.
When dilatation or
displacement, or
both, occur, the
power of rapidly
expelling its contents
is diminished
to the extent in
which the change
from the normal
position and size
takes place. I have
found that, if there
is a normal passing
down of the ingesta
and also of the
feces, the stomach
will perform its
functions perfectly.
Fear of “stomach
trouble” is groundless
if you keep the<span class="pagenum" title="63"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a></span>
digestive and eliminative apparatus in good working
order. But this requires that you must keep
them clean, and to do so you must drink plenty
of water before each meal.</p>

</div>

<p>The organs are held in position by a ligamentous
attachment and abundant fatty tissue, which serve<span class="pagenum" title="64"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a></span>
as a connective cushion that furnishes aid in supporting
the organs in their proper place. In chronic
cases of self-poisoning, the victim, as a rule, becomes
anemic and emaciated, and loses thereby the fatty
support required by the organs. They are consequently
apt to become displaced and the muscular
tissue weakened, with the consequent pendulous
condition of the abdomen often observed
in both children and adults.</p>

<p>The clay-colored, flabby, obese, anemic victims
may retain their worthless adipose tissue; but they
suffer quite as keenly as if they had lost it&mdash;from
the fact that this tissue is impregnated with poison
and filled with gas, and from the further fact that
this abnormal tissue presses on the vital organs
here and there as the victim wheezes or puffs along
on his road through existence.</p>

<p>There is not the slightest doubt that nine-tenths
of gastro-intestinal ills and their effects can be prevented
or cured by thorough irrigation of the canal,
from mouth to anus, if it does not itself perform
the cleansing process three times in twenty-four
hours.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

<span class="smcap">Methods of Stomach Cleansing</span>.</h2>


<p>Lavage is a term restricted to irrigation of the
stomach&mdash;a term that has become more or
less popular of late with physicians, but is not
so popular with those who have to swallow a rubber
stomach tube, or with the anxious mother or friends
who are usually not permitted to be present on
such occasions because of the disturbed and cyanotic
appearance of the patient&mdash;an appearance produced
by the introduction of the catheter. Much
can be said, however, of the good results following
irrigation of the stomach by the employment of
the stomach rubber tube, and in a special class of
cases its use is imperative.</p>

<p>But my purpose in this chapter is to advocate
the drinking of water as the means <i>par excellence</i>
for effective irrigation of the assimilative and eliminative
organs, and to make it plain that this form
of irrigation is essential for the preservation of
health and the relief and cure of chronic inactivity
of the principal organs of the system. Usually the
drinking of water at regular intervals is sufficient;
but in exceptional cases a generous drinking will
result in a complete unloading, which can be accomplished<span class="pagenum" title="66"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a></span>
with ease and with little loss of
time.</p>

<p>Should your stomach be actually performing its
office, the suggestions I am about to give will, if
followed, keep it sweet, clean, and in good condition,
and will also flush all the tissues of the body
as well.</p>

<p>The first duty on rising in the morning should
be that of flushing the colon, as previously recommended,
and flushing the stomach, as now recommended.
Take one or two goblets of water (about
eight ounces each) at a temperature most agreeable,
which, however, should not be ice cold. An
hour or half an hour later, during the breakfast,
take one goblet of milk and water or two of water
alone, when the mouth is free from food. About
eleven o’clock in the forenoon, one or two goblets
of spring or distilled water, at its natural temperature,
should be drunk to cleanse the stomach,
duodenum, kidneys, etc., and to flush the tissues of
the body. At the noon meal one or two goblets,
and at four or five in the afternoon a similar
amount, should be drunk&mdash;the latter as a cleanser
before the evening meal, at which about a pint or
more is drunk to aid in emulsifying the food, as at
the breakfast and noon repasts. As a rule, besides
the amounts drunk at meal-time, there should be
consumed as much as two quarts daily, and the
best time for this is when the stomach is empty, or
when it ought to be empty. At bedtime, one or
more glasses may be drunk if one does not suffer<span class="pagenum" title="67"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a></span>
from inconvenience from a full bladder during the
sleeping hours.</p>

<p>One should make water-drinking a habit, like
eating, sleeping, defecating, etc. Water-drinking
should be performed at regular periods during the
day. System is as essential for the harmonious
working of the organs as it is for the relations of
the departments in a business, or of the details of
any particular department. The guide to the order
and temperature to be adopted is <i>agreeable­ness</i>.
Find out by experiment what is most agreeable
and beneficial to you, and continue the practice
with slight variations adapted to the changes of the
seasons and the conditions of the system. There
must, however, be some training done in most
cases, and what is not agreeable at first may become
so.</p>

<p>All persons suffering from proctitis and colitis
and their symptoms, as described in the previous
chapters of this work and in <i>Intestinal Ills</i>, will
require, now and then, if not under treatment,
special irrigation of the stomach to remove fermentative
matter, particles of undigested food, and
tenacious, ropy mucus before the next meal is taken.
Otherwise the condition will be made doubly bad,
for the fresh material is piled on top of the unduly
retained contents of the stomach. As evidence of
our civilization, we clean pots and kettles before
the next meal. We even clean our fingers before,
during, and after the meal. Teeth, mouth, and
face get their proper cleansing. Why should we<span class="pagenum" title="68"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a></span>
suppose that stomach, duodenum, and kidneys,
which receive all sorts of stuff, should remain clean
without an occasional flushing? They need rinsing
out after brewing the wine of life. The water drunk
between meals not only cleanses the organs through
which it passes but irrigates the whole system, keeping
a normal amount of water in all the tissues,
which is as necessary for the maintenance of health
as is the due supply of water to the plant in your
conservatory.</p>

<p>Observe the large percentage of human beings
that are anemic, sallow, clay-colored, or white&mdash;a
few obese, but the many spare, lean, gaunt&mdash;all of
them expressing the disgust of the soul in having
such an abiding-place. If all the organs and tissues
of the body were kept flushed, what a fresh
and inviting spot the soul would have for the cultivation
here on earth of the arts of life!</p>

<p>Water is the wholesomest of all drinks. It
quickens the appetite and strengthens the digestion.
It is the most effective agent in the work of
elimination&mdash;in ridding the system of waste material.
Properly taken, it prevents the undue clogging
of the organs and tissues, and tends to cure or
relieve those that had become clogged, and it does
this by washing away the substances for which the
system has no further use, and which if they remained
would poison it.</p>

<p>It is said that if water be drunk freely during
a meal the gastric juice will become diluted or
washed away. A similar objection is offered concerning<span class="pagenum" title="69"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a></span>
the use of the enema. The horse, it is
alleged, should have more sense than to drink from
three to six gallons of water and almost immediately
thereafter eat a peck or more of oats and a
quantity of hay, for it ought to know that there is
no room for food with such an amount of water in
the stomach. If such objectors could but see the
horse smile at such arguments&mdash;for it secretly
knows that the water does not <i>remain</i> in its stomach,
and that its gastric juice is naturally strong
and needs dilution&mdash;they would stand aghast.
Would we not be better off if we were not influenced
by fool talk like the above advice to the horse,
especially as regards our internal economy?</p>

<p>The stomach, like the freight station, can accommodate
only a limited amount. Its contents must
be rapidly dispersed, and every muscular contraction
and every respiration gives it an impulse.
Disease and lack of irrigation will occasion an accumulation
or congestion of the contents in the
gastro-intestinal canal, and then the victim of slow
transit complains of indigestion, biliousness, flatulency,
uric acid, and of many other ills. Your foul,
furred tongue is a very good indication of the
trouble below, so it is wise to examine it in the
morning to learn your interior condition. Many
persons scrape their tongue with a knife because
of heavy coating and offensive odor and taste. Dyspeptics
of this order need a thorough internal bath
from above (per os) and from below (per anus).</p>

<p>Some that suffer from undue gastric retention<span class="pagenum" title="70"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a></span>
and indigestion will find relief by flushing the colon
and the stomach, as herein specifically directed.
Others may find it desirable to start with a mild
laxative and an intestinal wash-out with hot water
in which some antiseptic or stimulant has been dissolved.
The special stomach cleansing is accomplished
by the rapid drinking of one tumbler of
hot water after another, until a pint or more is
taken into the stomach, or until a sensation of
vomiting is felt, which may be encouraged by putting
the end of the finger down the throat as far as
possible or the end of a long lead-pencil wrapped
in a little muslin. After as much of the contents
of the stomach as is desired is thus cast forth, drink
freely of water again, as much as you may think
proper, which will be discharged into the duodenum.
If this gastro-cleansing has occurred near
meal-time omit the meal altogether, and in an hour
or two drink as much water as is agreeable, to
make sure of a thorough washing out of the erstwhile
neglected receptacle&mdash;the stomach. This
special washing out of the stomach may be repeated
as often as occasion demands it. It frequently
happens with some persons that an hour
after a meal there is a hint that all is not well. This
may be concealed or corrected by drinking a goblet
or two of water, which practice will permit the
brew to go on without further attention to the vat.</p>

<p>Water may be taken at all times of the day or
night if occasion arises for its therapeutic effect in
addition to its regular period of use. Usually<span class="pagenum" title="71"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a></span>
physic, pepsin, soda, charcoal, whiskey, etc., are
kept within reach, and are resorted to on such occasions
with the thought that one or more of them
will do the work. They will not, however, any more
than red paint will act as an antidote to poor health by
painting the cheeks with it. Water, hot water, especially
when used plentifully, is the only solvent of dirt.</p>

<p>Very few realize how essential water is to digestion
and to the digestive canal after the process of
digestion is completed; and that it has physiological
effects on the system generally is less widely known.
There exists a great natural demand for water to
carry on the normal functions of the system; for
both atmosphere and heat draw moisture from the
body, and a considerable amount is utilized in the
processes of our daily work and in unexpected efforts.
An organism composed of almost eighty per
cent. of water requires a generous supply for subsistence&mdash;a
supply equal to the expenditure of
vitality involved in carrying on the numerous functions
of body and brain.</p>

<p>Some day it will be discovered that water is
mainly the element employed in psycho-physiological
processes. Water is easily changed to air, and
atmospheric air to water, in the system. The
generous consumer of air and water will have a
good stock of vital or of psychical force on which
to draw for the process of thinking. A thinker is
a creator, and he must be successful if his thoughts
be rightly directed and he have an ample supply of
liquid food&mdash;water.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />

<span class="smcap">When Enemas Should Be Taken.</span></h2>


<p>Method is imperative in this strenuous life of
ours. Nature in her universal operations
seems to sanction a uniform system in our daily
conduct. Had we a regular time for doing things,
periodicity would be established in our sleeping,
eating, bathing, defecating, work, recreation, etc.
Unfortunately, we are prone to ignorance, self-indulgence,
procrastination, which render us careless
and reckless in regard to the common-sense conditions
of normal living; and before we are fairly out
of our ’teens we begin to bear a crop of proctitis,
colitis, con­sti­pa­tion, etc.</p>

<p>It is in this way that periodicity as to stooling is
lost, and whim, convenience, or necessity takes its
place. As a result, we dribble or strain under the
fecal and gaseous burden. This happy-go-lucky
method accounts for much of the gastro-intestinal
disorder complained of by so many, who “want to
die” when the painful neurasthenic blues hover
around and pervade their bodies like a dense fog.</p>

<p>The insidious manner in which proctitis, colitis,
con­sti­pa­tion, and self-poisoning progress from mild
through medium to severe stages does not, generally,<span class="pagenum" title="73"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a></span>
alarm the victim of intestinal neurasthenia
until many years have elapsed, and one or more of
the vital organs have become diseased, and the
whole system is thoroughly under its toxic effects.
Thus, slowly, are the various segments of the gastro-intestinal
canal changed to an abnormal condition.</p>

<p>Suppose the tissues of one of your arms and
hands were inflamed, constricted, or swollen, and
that the nerves of motion were uncertain, shaky,
and “kinky,”&mdash;all of which conditions we often
find in the digestive apparatus,&mdash;and that finally
recovery takes place under persevering and patient
treatment; how soon, think you, could a sensible
person expect the limb thus affected to become as
useful as its companion that had never been disturbed
by disease?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we have not two sets of bowels.
Ocean steamers are equipped with two sets of motion-producing
engines, so that the disability of one
will result in no loss of speed. When man places
as much commercial value on himself as he does on
his machines or on a boat, he will either induce
Nature to furnish him with an extra set of energy-producing
organs, or he will take the best possible
care of the only one she vouchsafes to him&mdash;a care
that extends from os to anus.</p>

<p>Civilized man does, indeed, take a little notice of
a sore mouth (although indifferent about an unclean
one), and will even try hard to have it heal, because
a sore mouth may be <i>seen</i>, and is likely to disfigure
him. But a sore anus and rectum may, for all he<span class="pagenum" title="74"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a></span>
seriously cares, play their painful and poisonous
pranks until he is put to bed disabled or is sent to
an asylum&mdash;or to the final inn where all diseases of
the body cease from troubling and the weary organs
are at rest.</p>

<p>To re-establish that normal régime of physiological
relations called health, after many years of
perverse relations and disorderly practices, obviously
requires time and intelligent, faithful
attention to prescribed conditions.</p>

<p>The factors or causes that militate against the
removal of curable diseases are:</p>

<p>(1) The neglect of a local disorder until it has
had time to exhaust the general vitality of the
system.</p>

<p>(2) Inattention on the part of the patient after
he has obtained temporary or partial relief.</p>

<p>(3) The victim arbitrarily setting his own time
limit for the cure of the disease.</p>

<p>(4) His wilful disobedience of prescribed rules.</p>

<p>(5) Inability to realize the importance of having
the cause removed, as well as the local symptoms.</p>

<p>Confining attention for the present to proctitis
and colitis, I wish to impress the patient, as well as
the physician, with the fact that no better measure
for relieving or removing these undermining disorders
can be adopted than the regular practice,
twice or thrice daily, of intestinal irrigation by
means of enemas. The persistent use of the
enema is directly influential in relieving and removing
the symptoms of such disorders. These<span class="pagenum" title="75"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a></span>
symptoms may be piles, prolapse, skinny tabs, fissure,
dull pains, soreness, itching channels, stricture
of the anus and rectum, ulceration, abscess, fistula,
cancer, etc.</p>

<p>In the early history of ulcerative proctitis and
colitis, the local symptoms at the anal vent may
not be noticeable; yet the disease may be quite
well developed for six or nine inches along the
bowels. The early or more obscure symptoms are
mild and unnoticeable; then they progress into
notice, sometimes most sharply; finally we have
severe and chronic con­sti­pa­tion, indigestion, flatulency,
diarrhea, etc., and, keeping pace with these,
we have the stages of self-poisoning, which is
known as auto-infection or auto-intoxication.</p>

<p>With other measures, the most effective for relieving
and removing these symptoms of proctitis
and colitis is the enema night and morning. During
the long period of relaxation at night, the functions
of elimination and repair are, with the great
majority of us, going on under abnormal conditions&mdash;such,
for instance, as excessive fermentation
and bacterial putre­fac­tion, which generate poisonous
gases that are absorbed by the nerves and
bring about the condition of <i>malaise</i> we complain
of when we rise in the morning. We then find our
bowels distended and ready for relief&mdash;and also,
strangely, “not ready”!</p>

<p>Before dressing, therefore, is the time to relieve
the excessive pressure from gases and feces, and a
slight enema is accordingly advisable, say from<span class="pagenum" title="76"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a></span>
half a pint to a pint of water, which should be expelled
at once. This removal of the contents of
the rectum and perhaps of the sigmoid flexure will
permit the contents of the ascending and transverse
colon to pass more readily toward and into the sigmoid
flexure, as though they had been invited to
come; and, indeed, such passage is rendered inevitable
by the removal of the local gas and feces in
their path. When half an hour or more has passed
and breakfast is over, it is time for the regular and
complete evacuation of the bowels, by the aid of
the internal bath, or, as some describe it, by a full
flushing of the colon.</p>

<p>In our early efforts to establish harmony and
periodicity with the enema, it is advisable to resort
to a mild vegetal laxative, in some cases, rather
than to let the tongue indicate so much foulness
and allow the feelings to become so intensely blue
that they cannot be hidden by even the utmost
effort at pleasantry. Extreme cases may call for
different aids toward relief, until, one by one, these
aids may be dropped&mdash;the last one to be discontinued
being the enema.</p>

<p>For a short time at the start it is, perhaps, best
to confine one’s self to two enemas, especially if
fairly successful with the attempt at a thorough
cleansing after breakfast and before retiring at
night. The sleep will be sounder and the patient
will be more apt to rise refreshed with a clean
tongue and cheerful spirits. So much will this
before-bed enema do for him that he may soon<span class="pagenum" title="77"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a></span>
find it unnecessary to take the preliminary injection
on rising, inasmuch as fermentation and gas
will no longer trouble him. But individual experience
and intelligence must dictate the course in
this respect. Let the patient study himself and
note the demands of his system. It may even be,
indeed it is frequently the case, that a patient requires
several enemas during the day. When abnormality
has set in, it gives rise to all sorts of
freak requirements, and the victim must, for a
time, accede to its whims.</p>

<p>Quite frequently, owing to various causes, the
feces will descend into the rectum, which is properly
a conduit, not a receptacle. While there it
occasions much nervous irritation of the whole
system and makes its victim desperate. It is wise,
under such a condition, to take slight injections for
relief. Never allow any foulness to accumulate.
Establish the <i>habit</i> of internal cleanliness. The
new sense of bodily purity will be so great that it
can never be outgrown.</p>

<p>Nature easily accommodates herself to habits,
whatever they be&mdash;normal or abnormal, wholesome
or unwholesome, cleanly or uncleanly; and the
train of consequences will be accordingly good or
evil. My point may be easily illustrated by the
habits of “civilized” man in regard to bathing.
Many persons never take an external bath, and
are not conscious of any bodily discomfort arising
from the omission of this presumably necessary
practice. As the summer approaches, another batch<span class="pagenum" title="78"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a></span>
of “civilizees,” so fortunate as to be within convenient
distance of a pond, lake, river, or ocean, begin
to feel the real need of a “dip,” and are uncomfortable
until they get it. This is surely a sign
that the spirit of cleanliness is beginning to stir in
the breast of humanity. Then there is another
contingent that bathe once a week, and should
their regular routine in this respect be interfered
with they would at once feel unclean&mdash;nay, even
dirty, and, sometimes, “nasty.” Others, again,
bathe twice or thrice weekly, and this quota of
the human race feels very uncomfortable and foul
when hindered for a week from following this routine;
indeed, such bathers often imagine that a dire
illness is impending. Finally, the “salt of the
earth” take an external bath once or twice a day,
and, should <i>their</i> routine be suspended for twenty-four
hours, visions of madness or suicide begin to
haunt them until relieved by soap and hot water,
or the cold plunge, as their habits require.</p>

<p>Of course, the same rule applies to the routine
concerning the teeth, facial ablutions, etc. Nature
is stored habit, and she feels outraged when her
proprieties are disregarded. Let us pray, therefore,
that the habit of cleanliness may become
contagious!</p>

<p>Now, the parallel between external and internal
cleanliness is quite obvious. Those whose bowels
move but once in two or three days do not realize
how foul they are. Others have a scant evacuation
once in twenty-four hours, and they imagine<span class="pagenum" title="79"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a></span>
that they are as clean as those that take an external
bath once a week think themselves to be.
Still others have two stools daily, and they feel as
clean internally as those that take three external
baths weekly. And, finally, there are a few who,
defecating thrice daily, feel quite as clean as does
the most persistent external bather. Thus we see
that cleanliness, external and internal, is a habit, a
new nature, attended with exquisite comfort and
pleasure&mdash;a quality that may lead to the goal of
divine purity in realizing the joys of hydropathy.</p>

<p>The wild woodland flower grew and blossomed
without attention, attracting but little interest.
After, however, the florist has cultivated it to the
high stage of development in which we find it to-day,
with its stalk, stem, leaf, and fragrant petals
displaying their marvelous symmetry and beauty,
we begin to appreciate the value of labor, pains,
cultivation. In like manner, it is our imperative
duty to give proper care to every requisite detail
in the transformation of our body into a human
flower of health, grace, joy, and harmony.</p>

<p>The great majority of those that do me the
honor to read what I have to say on internal and
external cleanliness will, doubtless, not agree with
me as to the frequency of the ablutions in twenty-four
hours. Yet I have a suspicion that if my objectors
were to try an external and an internal bath,
on both rising and retiring, they would soon consider
the practice too delightful to be foregone;
they would soon develop more sweetness of character<span class="pagenum" title="80"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a></span>
and be more particular as to the purity of
their nether garments, and, finally, would seem
ensphered by an atmosphere peopled with angels.</p>

<p>My proposition is this: First make a man clean,
internally and externally, and thus you may make
him good; after you have made him good you can
make him healthy in both body and mind; after you
have made him healthy you can make him full of
joy.</p>

<p>To recapitulate: A good time to take your internal
bath is about half an hour after each meal.
Cultivate regularity in this, and Nature will second
your efforts and establish a periodicity for you
by her suggestive impulse and call. Our internal
economy should not be slighted as it has been.
The intestines are good, faithful, patient servitors,
ready to perform their lowly office even when we
are inattentive and heedless. Sometimes, however,
they become rebellious, after they have stood
more abuse than one would think them capable of
standing. Let us reform our bad habits; our servitors
are willing to enter with us into better habits,
and co-operate with us in a truly human life. Can
you not spare a few minutes, three times a day, at
<i>regular periods</i>, for inner purification? You will
find it very easy when once you make it a matter
of routine.</p>

<p>Now note this point: The work of your brain
depends on the power sent to it by the gastro-intestinal
canal. A motor car goes no faster than
the power furnished enables it to go. So your<span class="pagenum" title="81"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a></span>
brain activity is ever on a par with the energy supplied
from this usually despised intestinal source;
that is, it can never rise higher than the supply of
this energy warrants, and it always falls to the
level of this supply, for it depends on it absolutely
for sustaining power. It would seem, therefore,
that common sense would be sufficient to shame
us into keeping clean, scrupulously clean, the canal
that supplies us with working force&mdash;the canal that
extends without a break from mouth to anus. Yet
my experience shows that almost everybody cares
more for his outsides than for his insides&mdash;more
for squandering his stored energy than for looking
out for its constant renewal&mdash;and that most patients
are foul all the way down.</p>

<p>Well-fed animals that have the range of Nature
are plump, and have healthy hair, skin, teeth, etc.,
because their intestinal organs perform their functions
frequently and fully. When animals become
domesticated and “civilized,” they become con­sti­pated
and catch various human illnesses or grow
a crop of their own. Well-fed “humanals” grow
thin and puny, or bloated with gas, looking like
corpulent clay men, without natural teeth, without
natural hair, their skin dry and of a sickly hue,
bloodless, fading away because of an early blight
before they have completed their early growth.
Heredity is blamed for the bloodless, nerveless,
brainless body, when, as a matter of fact, its degeneration
is due to foulness within.</p>

<p>Birds, beasts, and savages (more fortunate than<span class="pagenum" title="82"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a></span>
civilized man) have the wide earth on which to
stool when Nature calls. Their handy water-closet
enables them to enjoy good health. As civilization
advances, and business and social customs become
more complex, water-closets get fewer and less accessible.
As a consequence, man has to use his
large intestine for a storehouse. He has done this
so long that it seems impossible to break him of
the foul habit. But he is paying the penalty.
Many have abused the bladder in the same way,
and had this been a large organ like its brother,
the colon, we would long ago have heard the stereotyped
excuse in regard to this function, “Oh, any
time to urinate that I can find will do.” Those
who object to the new order of bowel relief should,
on the same principle, object to frequent bladder
relief.</p>

<p>I submit this proposition to the judgment of unprejudiced
minds: Is it not reasonable that so
harmless and efficient a remedy as the internal
bath should be adopted by all intelligent persons?
Inasmuch as neglect&mdash;due to social, business, and
other customs, and to lack of conveniences for
ready relief&mdash;has brought upon us so much fecal
poisoning and local disorders and so many abnormal
and pernicious systemic results, it should not
be considered too great a task to take an internal
bath three times a day to amend our outrage on
Nature&mdash;an outrage that involves our health and
general well-being, here and hereafter. We owe
it, not only to our possibilities, but also to posterity,<span class="pagenum" title="83"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a></span>
that fecal poisoning be banished. We have no
right to communicate such a taint to our children.
They have a right to be free from such poison.
Do we ever think of their claims in this regard?
Let us leave them a better legacy, by adopting the
thrice-a-day use of the enema for the purification
of the alimentary canal!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />

<span class="smcap">How Enemas Should Be Taken.</span></h2>

<h3>METHODS OF INTESTINAL IRRIGATION.</h3>


<p>A satisfactory appliance for taking an
enema should possess the following features:
capacity, adaptability, convenience, cleanliness, durability,
and sufficient external anal and water
pressure to effect a thorough flushing or an agreeable
vaginal injection while one is in a sitting
position over a water-closet bowl.</p>

<p>There are several postures in which an enema
may be taken. For those physically able, the most
convenient, cleanly, and comfortable manner in
which the thrice-daily inner bath may be had is the
usual upright position on a water-closet seat. For
those not physically able to sit upright, or for those
that are not up-to-date and still adhere to the use
of the fountain or the bulb syringe, the best method
is not the usual sitting position, but the recumbent
one. They are advised to lie on the right side, or
on the back with hips raised. As a rule, a water-closet
room is too small for reclining purposes, and,
besides, the necessary rubber sheet and toweling
convenience may be absent. Another drawback to<span class="pagenum" title="85"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a></span>
lying full length for the purpose of flushing the
colon is that with short arms and the lack of <i>external
anal pressure</i> there is apt to be an escape of
water and feces around the anal point, necessitating
much cleansing, considerable annoyance from nasty
odors, and an irritating waste of time.</p>

<p>Various devices, advertised as great inventions,
have been resorted to for the purpose of overcoming
such malodorous and uncleanly incidents.
Among them is one that may be described as a
colon tube, ranging from nine to eighteen inches in
length, which can be attached to a fountain or a
bulb syringe. The tube is usually of flexible rubber,
<i>colored red</i> to hide as much as possible the cumulative
evidence of saturated filth and bacterial poison,
the presence of which a white tube would betray
too readily.</p>

<p>I fail to see the necessity of introducing a rubber
canal of such length into an intestinal channel five
feet long for the purpose of “cleansing” the latter.
The project lacks common sense. What a ridiculous
practice&mdash;to worm or bore a hole through the
impacted feces as you work your tube upward, then
to squirt a little water into the middle of things,
or as near to the middle as you have managed to
get with a tube that will persist in bending on itself,
and then to withdraw it covered with liquid
filth! What folly to put a canal <i>into</i> a canal&mdash;the
one inserted being one-fifth the length of the one
to be cleansed! Is not the original physiological
channel good enough to convey the antiseptic water<span class="pagenum" title="86"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a></span>
or oil, or both? Why not have the rubber canal
five or six feet long if <i>one</i> foot is so essential?</p>

<p>We should remember that ulcerative proctitis and
colitis have made the use of the enema a necessity;
that, accordingly, the diseased, constricted gut or
canal must be treated very gently and not irritated
in any avoidable way. The least irritation will result
in still greater muscular contraction. It stands
to reason that the effort to reach the healthy portion
of the bowel with a slightly flexible colon tube
frustrates its own purpose, and that it is besides a
source of serious and unnecessary irritation. While
this rubber tube is being forced up one’s bowels it
often becomes lodged here and there in the valves
and folds of the mucous membrane. It has been
found that the effort used to dislodge it sometimes
results in a doubling of the tube on itself in the
form of a knot, and that the end first introduced
comes back to the anus waiting to escape with the
next push! We need not argue that this forced
looping and knotting of the tube is very injurious
to the diseased intestinal region, and that no one
would care to introduce it two or three times a
day.</p>

<p>Does not common sense suggest that the rational
way is to open the bore of the alimentary canal by
beginning at its <i>end</i>; that <i>liquid</i> should be applied
directly to the first feces encountered, and that as
this impacted mass is removed the progress should
be successfully upward? The liquid as it enters
dilates the channel, and as it passes on and up it<span class="pagenum" title="87"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a></span>
eventually gets beyond the diseased section of the
bowels. Here, by a gentle and soothing dilatation,
we create at once an impulse in the imprisoned
feces and gases to descend and escape. What
other method is so kindly, and yet so effectual?
We avoid, by this means, irritating the diseased
and constricted muscular canal; whereas by the
tube method we occasion still greater contraction,
the inflamed surface having a tendency to contract
and close tightly over the tube. The flood of
liquid dilates the canal; whereas the forced rubber
tube, by irritation, contracts it. Besides, as has
been pointed out, the conduct of the tube working
in the dark is most uncertain.</p>

<p>Suppose the rubber tube does finally reach the
section of the colon free from inflammation; that
its passage thither has greatly increased the spasmodic
contraction of the diseased portion of the
gut, and that, of course, it had great difficulty in
circum­venting the resistance offered by the valves,
curves, and short bends&mdash;suppose all this, and an
idea of how the contents of the bowel above the
diseased zone are imprisoned will dawn upon you.
For, after the tube has reached this point of impaction,
the distention there is most unduly increased
by the sudden gush of water, and, what is
of still graver import, the presence of the tube
prevents its return flow. Then as the object is
being removed the watery feces following closely
after are impeded by the increased irritative contraction
set up by the tube.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="88"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a></span></p>

<p>In short, this greatly extolled colon tube subjects
the region of proctitis and colitis, as well as the
healthy section, to just such objectionable procedure
until the amount of water injected becomes
so extremely large that a means of escape is irresistibly
produced by the great pressure above. Is
it wise treatment to irritate the diseased portion
of the bowels, and to distend still further the
healthy portion above, in order to get rid of distention
due to feces and gases? Without increasing
the danger by injecting water into the already
unduly distended colon by the use of the tube, the
imprisoned feces and gases of themselves alone
have been known to exert sufficient pressure to
occasion prolapse of the sigmoid flexure into
the rectum or undue displacement of the organ.
Surely it were better to get rid of the imprisoned
contents by removing them from near the vent and
working one’s way gradually upward than to add
more to the store and burden, which only causes
unendurable excitement and fierce demands for
relief.</p>

<p>The rectal enema, taken in the rational way,
simply dilates the portion of the gut that is morbidly
contracted&mdash;a procedure that is very beneficial
and should be continued just so long as any
remnant of the inflammation remains in the tissues.
Kindly treatment is essential, because ulcerative
inflammation is an irritable condition and tends to
contract the muscular tissue at the slightest touch
of a foreign substance. What, I repeat, is more<span class="pagenum" title="89"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a></span>
kind and soothing than antiseptic water mixed with
oil?</p>

<p>Advocates of the colon tube assert that water
entering the lower portion of the rectum will occasion
ballooning of this portion of the gut. After
an experience covering twenty or more years, I am
in a position to say that there is absolutely nothing
in this objection&mdash;that water used in this way cannot
produce such a pathological condition. Ballooning
of the lower portion of the rectum is
occasioned by <i>impaction of feces</i>, which remain
lodged often for weeks or months at a time in this
locality. Whatever dilatation the use of the enema
may transiently produce would be only healthy
exercise for the diseased organ. An instrument is
frequently used properly to dilate the more or less
contracted canal above and below the distended
pouch for a distance of from six to ten or more
inches. Nothing but good results can follow the
proper use of the enema two or three times a day
in all forms of local disease of the anus, rectum, and
colon.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />

<span class="smcap">The Internal Fountain Bath.</span></h2>

<h3>THE AUTHOR’S UNIQUE INVENTION.</h3>


<p>The author has searched the markets of the
world for suitable apparatus for intestinal irrigation,
so that he, as a specialist in this line and in
anal and rectal diseases, could recommend it to his
patients. None of the appliances to be had, however,
quite answered the purpose he had in view.
All of them had some drawbacks. Owing to this
fact, after much experimentation he has invented an
instrument that is herein fully described to show
its serviceable­ness. Were this volume to be issued
without this description, the author would be inundated
with interrogatories concerning the best
instrument to be employed by its readers, or
whether the appliances they have on hand would
answer the purpose. As the object of this book is
practical, not literary, it is not out of place, the author
thinks, to describe the invention and its unique
serviceable­ness, as well as its special adaptability for
the tri-daily employment of enemas.</p>

<p>The instrument is known as “The Internal Fountain
Bath for Home Treatment.” The following<span class="pagenum" title="91"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a></span>
illustration gives a very good idea of its construction
and merits:</p>

</div>

<p>The Internal and External Fountain Bath is an
appliance that I have devised and supplied to my
patients for many years with most satisfactory<span class="pagenum" title="92"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92"></a></span>
results in every particular. Several other enemata
and recurrent douche instruments which I have
used did not wholly meet the requirements in
capacity or aseptic features; but long use of this
apparatus in all the various bowel troubles has
demonstrated, to me as well as to my students and
patients, that the instrument is the best that can
be made, perfectly meeting all the requirements
essential for scientific results.</p>


<p class="tac"><i>Features and Uses.</i></p>

<p>The Fountain Bath is the product of necessity,
effort, and long experience in accomplishing a definite
purpose fully and properly. Figure 18 illustrates
a large enamelled metal reservoir for water.
Figure 21 shows a hard rubber combined enema
and recurrent douche appliance for the application
of water to the mucous membrane of the large intestine,
the temperature of which should range from
ninety to one hundred and thirty-five degrees or
more. To one end of the handle is attached a hard
rubber anal cone (<ins title="Transcriber’s note: Reference to Figures 25, 26, 27, 29 is misleading – the numbers identify labelled items within the illustration, not figures in their own right. There is a ‘real’ Figure 23 elsewhere in the book.">Figure 27</ins>), inside of which is a
valve (Figure 29), which is opened and closed by
turning the handle, permitting the water to pass
through the rectal point (Figure 25), or (Figure 26)
into the bowels and return into the toilet basin
without removing the point. At the other end of
the handle is attached a glass reservoir for the use
of oils. Figure 22 is a metal handle with a glass
reservoir and a hard rubber anal cone. Figure 23<span class="pagenum" title="93"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93"></a></span>
is a metal handle without glass reservoir, and both
are intended for the use of water at a temperature
of from ninety to one hundred and five or one
hundred and ten degrees. A thermometer is absolutely
necessary to determine the temperature of
the water during its use as a depurent and antiphlogistic
remedy. The heating appliance will keep
the water at a desired temperature during its
application, which is a very essential feature indeed.</p>


<p class="tac"><i>Water Capacity.</i></p>

<p>The Fountain Bath reservoir holds three gallons
of water, which is quite sufficient to meet all requirements
of the various complicated cases of bowel
and uterine troubles which require a generous
supply of tepid or very hot water. This obviates
any interruption in the use of the enema or the
recurrent douche treatment until one or both are
satisfactorily completed, and without changing one’s
position on the toilet seat. It requires a quantity
of water to irrigate the large intestine, which is
some five feet long and two and a half inches in
diameter. It is foolish to attempt to irrigate one
end of a long, tortuous, foul sewer with one or
two quarts of water and hope for good results.
Water is cheap, then why not clean out and keep
clean?</p>


<p class="tac"><i>Adaptability.</i></p>

<p>For the first time in the history of enemata appliances
can an enema, recurrent douche, or vaginal<span class="pagenum" title="94"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a></span>
injection be taken with water at any desired temperature
and at the same time be medicated with
any remedy desired. External pressure against the
anal orifice is regulated at will; also the flushing of
the integument about the anus and buttocks is
easily accomplished before leaving the toilet seat.</p>


<p class="tac"><i>Convenience.</i></p>

<p>This scientific device can be used without assistance.
It has one feature moreover, that renders
it unique among rectal appliances, namely that you
may take a number of rapid injections without
changing your seat. You may inject a small quantity
of water (from eight to twelve ounces), and
expel it immediately; then you may follow with a
larger amount (from one to three pints), and expel
that also, then in the same manner flush the colon.
A complete internal bath may be effected in the
same way by using three, four or more quarts of
water. In this way, thorough depurating results
may be obtained. The several preliminary injections
of gradually increasing quantities of water
free the lower bowel of feces, germs, and gases
which otherwise might be forced by the flushing
process backward into and along the colon. With
the Internal Fountain Bath, unlike other syringes,
it is not inconvenient to take preliminary injections
before flushing the bowels. After the flushing the
rectal and anal canals the bowels can be easily
cleaned their entire length, as can also the integument<span class="pagenum" title="95"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a></span>
about the anus and buttocks by letting the
jet of water play on these parts to wash away any
germs and other poisonous discharges. All the
necessary movements of the anal point are easily
made with the handle which projects between the
limbs in front of the toilet seat.</p>


<p class="tac"><i>Cleanliness.</i></p>

<p>The water reservoir is enameled white, both
inside and out and free from poisonous substances.
The enamel is not injured by the use of any germicidal
remedies that may be placed in the water, or
by the water being brought to a very high temperature
to destroy bacterial poisons. Furthermore
this enameled surface is easily cleaned, thus
avoiding foulness of the reservoir from continued
use. The glass medicine case and anal cone attached
to the handle, as well as the anal point, are
all detachable and easily cleaned, and the handle
is of sufficient length to obviate soiling the hands
and impregnating them with odors.</p>

<p>To bring away a quantity of feces does not exhaust
the purpose of the enema. The intestinal
sewer requires further cleaning from end to end,
and the external parts around the anus as well.
By playing a jet of water on the external anal
region you finish the enema and avoid the very
uncleanly practice of using “toilet paper” as a
means of external cleansing. It is strange that
otherwise cleanly people are content with such<span class="pagenum" title="96"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a></span>
uncleanly treatment of these parts. They imagine
that “toilet paper” will effectually remove
the excrement and its attending odors. They
would not think it sufficient thus to clean their
hands if soiled by excrementitious matter. It is
the old story, “out of sight, out of mind,” and of
letting any make-shift in such cases answer; but
the spirit of cleanliness is abroad in the land, and
the Silent Club of the Cleanly is being formed
through just such agencies as the Internal Fountain
Bath. Many have doubtless longed for a better
practice but did not know what to do. The “toilet
paper” habit will pass with the once-a-day habit of
stooling, the con­sti­pa­tion habit, and the physic
habit, for all four are uncleanly in the extreme.</p>


<p class="tac"><i>Durability.</i></p>

<p>The enameled metal reservoir and the metal and
hard-rubber parts of the handle ought, with care,
to last a lifetime; the soft-rubber tube, if properly
cared for, will be of service for a long time.</p>


<p class="tac"><i>External Anal Pressure.</i></p>

<p>This is of very important assistance in flushing
the colon, as it aids in preventing the return of the
injected water, and thereby promotes its conveyance
along the colon until it arrives at the surgically
famous vermiform appendix. It is not strange that
both ends of the large intestine&mdash;the anus and<span class="pagenum" title="97"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a></span>
rectum and the appendix region&mdash;have kept the
surgeons busy, and I may add the undertaker likewise.
These two ends are of extraordinary concern,
because they manifest intense symptoms and pathological
consequences. Modern medical practice is
the heroic treatment of symptoms and consequences
and not patient search for causes of disease and
sensible treatment of it, as explained in my treatise
dealing with “Intestinal Ills,” as well as in the
present volume.</p>


<p class="tac"><i>Water Pressure.</i></p>

<p>Two or three gallons of water, suspended at the
usual height of enemata appliance, affords quite
enough pressure, especially when the outlet and
tubing are amply large. The shut-off on the rubber
tube enables the user to gauge the flow of water to
a nicety.</p>


<p class="tac"><i>Time Required.</i></p>

<p>The time required for taking an internal bath&mdash;that
is, for a complete flushing of the bowels&mdash;will
vary in individual cases. After removing the local
deposits in and near the rectum by one or two rapid
injections of very small quantities of water, two to
four quarts are taken into the intestinal canal at
one time, and this constitutes the enema proper.
Now, many persons will find it advantageous to let
the flushing water enter very slowly, taking from<span class="pagenum" title="98"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a></span>
two to five minutes, or even more. With some, if
the water is allowed to flow in very rapidly, the
various segments of the rectum and colon may not
readily accommodate themselves to the inflow, and
will too soon make an expulsive effort, returning
the water before it has dissolved the feces or united
with them, thus defeating the object sought through
the enema. With other persons, however, the flow
may be as rapid as desired. The speed must be
left to individual judgment and experience.</p>


<p class="tac"><i>Temperature of Water for an Enema.</i></p>

<p>The chief purpose of an enema is to produce
depuratory results; that is, to remove morbid matter
from the bowels and then to cleanse them. To
accomplish this effectively and at the same time to
avoid exciting an increased flow of blood to the
diseased gut, the water should be about the normal
temperature of the body, which is about <span class="nowrap">98 <span class="fraction"><span class="fnum">1</span><span class="bar">/</span><span class="fden">2</span></span></span> degrees.
Water too hot or too cold will aggravate
the sensitive, inflamed surface; and, as it is this
very inflammation that causes the abnormal action
of the bowels for the relief of which the enema is
taken, the temperature of the water is most important.
If it range between 90 and 105 degrees it will
do, for within those extremes it will not be likely to
increase the existing chronic engorgement of the
tissues. Under no circum­stances should very hot
or very cold water be used for the removal of fecal
accumulation. Physicians so incompetent as to<span class="pagenum" title="99"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a></span>
make a wrong diagnosis of the cause of chronic
con­sti­pa­tion and its numerous symptoms often
prescribe a wrong treatment in the use of water.
From two to ten minutes’ use of very hot or very
cold water in cases of proctitis and colitis will only
increase the chronic engorgement of the blood-vessels
and tissues and increase the morbid symptoms.
When water is applied to the mucous membrane
anywhere throughout the body, I use it hot exclusively,
as that temperature has then certain advantages
over cold. In the chapters treating upon
the different uses of hot water, I give the hydro-therapeutic
action of such liquid on the tissues of
the body.</p>


<p class="tac"><i>Quantity of Water to be Used.</i></p>

<p>The quantity of water to be injected into the
colon at one time must vary in each case and also
on each occasion. In the beginning of its use and
for some time following, a greater amount may be
required than will be necessary when, with its continued
use, a better action of the bowels becomes
established.</p>

<p>In cases of chronic con­sti­pa­tion and semi-con­sti­pa­tion,
the kidneys, lungs, mucous membrane, and
skin eliminate a daily accumulation of feces from
the system equal to two-thirds or three-fourths of
the amount of normal feces. This accounts for the
frequency of chronic disease of these organs. To
establish a new régime in the mode of fecal and
gaseous elimination requires much time and patience<span class="pagenum" title="100"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a></span>
in the use of the enema. Nearly all persons
can take the enema with comfort and satisfaction.
Now and then, however, there is a person who finds
it a little troublesome to inject over a quart of water
at one time, while most persons can inject over four
quarts without inconvenience. I would advise patience
and perseverance on the part of those who
find it irksome to inject a sufficient amount thoroughly
to cleanse the colon, or the portion thereof
involved in undue accumulation.</p>

<p>Enough water should be injected to bring away
what would constitute the normal amount of feces
to be passed at a regular stool. Gradually, as the
practice is established by the use of the enema
twice or thrice daily, it will be easy to determine
the proper amount of feces to pass. And note this
fact: it is just as easy to establish the habit of
three evacuations in twenty-four hours as of two
or one.</p>

<p>Whenever the amount of water injected proves
sufficient at any time to bring away all the feces
that should pass, it is not necessary at that sitting
to repeat the dose, except it be for subsequent
cleansing, as a sort of gargle. No possible harm
can come from the generous use of the enema
during a lifetime; indeed, its constant use will
prolong life and make it more comfortable.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />

<span class="smcap">Benefits of the Inner Bath.</span></h2>


<p>I speak from clinical observation with the use
of various rectal and colon specula, of which I
have over fifty. I have watched the progress of
cases that were using the enema twice or thrice
daily, and of cases that were also using the intestinal
recurrent douche, which latter required an
hour’s continuous application of hot water, and I
know, therefore, whereof I speak when I affirm its
salutary effect both on the local organs and on the
general system.</p>

<p>Many that write about the use or abuse of the
enema have never seen the mucous membrane of
the rectum and colon. Most of what is written on
the subject is worthless. The author of this book
writes from the accumulated experience of daily examinations
with specula for a period of over twenty-three
years. Had he merely used his fingers or hand
for making rectal examinations, or had he contented
himself with prescribing for symptoms reported by
the sufferer, his views and opinions as to the use
and benefits of the internal bath would have been
on a par with those that, by the old methods, make
futile efforts in diagnosis and treatment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="102"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a></span></p>

<p>Some good souls now and then become oversolicitous
as to the matter they should pass when
their bowels are already empty, and they feel
alarmed if the enema fails to produce an evacuation.
Such timid ones should remember that what
they cannot accomplish at one time and with one
attempt they may at the next, and that thus slowly
the new order of fecal elimination will become
established. It takes time and patience; but is
this cause for apprehension when diagnosis, treatment,
and means of relief are right? I claim that
flushing of the colon is the best means for removal
of the consequences of proctitis and colitis, and
that it should be employed by all that have these
chronic ailments. Let them get relief for the
<i>symptoms</i> at once and in this rational way, after
which let them seek scientific treatment for the ailments
themselves; for, sooner or later, they will
be compelled to seek it by the severe complications
that will inevitably set in.</p>


<h3>TRY SCIENTIFIC AND PRACTICAL MEASURES.</h3>

<p>Some persons find difficulty in estimating&mdash;or
think they do, which in most cases is nearer the
truth&mdash;the amount of water they can inject at one
time, when it would work a great relief to their
bowels were they able to inject from two to four
quarts. It is half the battle to know your efforts
are rightly directed; for, when you are defeated,
you will try a thousand and one changes&mdash;an experiment<span class="pagenum" title="103"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103"></a></span>
first with one element of the difficulty and
then with another. You will experiment with the
temperature, with the speed of flow into the rectum
and colon, with intermittent flow, etc. Be a little
scientific and original in this matter, I pray you,
<i>and know no defeat</i>!</p>

<p>As to the intermittent flow, the following way
may be found judicious in some cases: Take in
just sufficient water&mdash;a few ounces perhaps&mdash;to
provoke an evacuation, and proceed till you have
taken half a dozen or more. After this you can
take a greater quantity for a washout. But this is
not exactly what is meant by the term “intermittent
flow.” It means that you may make the experiment&mdash;if
you find it difficult to fill up after
ridding yourself of the local accumulation&mdash;of
turning off the stop-cock for a moment, thus giving
your bowels a slight rest, and then turning it on
again, alternating in this way for some minutes.
Many little devices of similar utility will suggest
themselves to those who know no defeat. Remember
that, now that you are in serious trouble, it is
not the easiest thing in the world to get out of
it.</p>

<p>Should your stomach raise objections to the
enema, change the time. If abdominal pains are
severe, change the temperature of the water and
the time and manner of injecting it. In other
words, do something different, but be determined
to conquer and take the internal bath at proper
periods every day.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="104"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104"></a></span></p>


<h3>LIBERATING THE WATER.</h3>

<p>Some persons who find no trouble at all in taking
a large quantity of water have much difficulty in
expelling it, or rather in expelling all of it at once.
Various methods may be resorted to to liberate
the retained water. One is to inject a little more,
as a provoker, when all will escape without further
difficulty. Another method is to resort to various
motions of the arms and body. Some find relief
by raising and projecting both arms together slowly,
and then stretching and holding them aloft for a
few moments. Other methods are: to twist the
trunk a few times, to walk up and down a little, to
bend forward and backward, etc. Still another
method is to massage the abdominal walls, beginning
at the ascending colon (see Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_12">12</a>), passing
upward to the left along the transverse colon, and
then downward until the lower portion of the sigmoid
flexure is reached. When beginning the
massage, one should use stroking movements from
right to left over the entire surface, and then go
over it again with rotary strokes. Some may find
it advantageous to knead the abdominal muscles,
gradually reaching the deeper parts as the air is expelled
from the lungs, which expulsion may change
the position of the various segments of the intestine
and thus afford an opportunity for the feces,
gases, and water to escape. Before rising in the
morning and retiring at night, it will be found advantageous
by some persons to spend about ten<span class="pagenum" title="105"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a></span>
minutes in making the three kinds of manipulations
described. It is an excellent practice for
every one to lie flat on the chest and abdomen and
draw in several deep breaths just before rising.
This exercise will strengthen the muscles of those
parts and benefit the internal organs as well.</p>


<h3>THE ENEMA AS A PERMANENT PRACTICE.</h3>

<p>In the effort to restore the long-abused bowel to
its normal functioning by the use of the enema and
massage, there may be, in the beginning of such
treatment, an exceptional case in which a mild laxative
is indicated as the desirable thing, rather than
that a furred tongue and base bodily feelings shall
evidence too much foulness all the way up to the
mouth.</p>

<p>The enema, of course, constitutes the chief means
and mainstay of relief from ob­sti­pa­tion of the bowels,
and one by one the other aids are to be omitted.
Moreover, when the time comes that the bowel is
freed from the disease that occasioned the occlusion
and ob­sti­pa­tion,&mdash;that is to say, when the bowels
evacuate themselves naturally three times a day,&mdash;then
the enema itself may be omitted, or it may
be continued without harm by those whose sense
of cleanliness would induce them to keep up the
practice in preference to the uncleanly habit of
using toilet paper as a partial means toward cleanliness.
Surely there is no harm in substituting
a better habit for a worse one&mdash;one, moreover, that<span class="pagenum" title="106"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a></span>
we should be ashamed to continue! As no one
would think of cleaning his soiled fingers with
toilet paper, as already said, so no one with any
real sense of decency will continue the attempt to
clean his anal orifice with such material when he
has learned a better and more effective way. Likewise,
after having learned the rational mode of relieving
the surcharged bowels, no wise person will
continue the use of physic, coarse food, gymnastic
exercises, and other futile and foolish practices as
remedial measures for intestinal ailments.</p>

<p>No one suffering from proctitis and colitis can
have a clean and healthy sigmoid flexure and rectum
unless these be kept clean by the regular use,
three times a day, of the enema. From the day
when the disease invades these parts there is and
will continue to be a clogged, plastered, or incrusted
passage for more or less of the entire length of the
colon. This must be so in the nature of things,
since these organs are unable to perform their functions
while the disease is present. Just think of
possessing a filthy, congested intestinal canal, without
one day of real cleanliness for twenty, forty,
sixty, or more years! It is not the easiest thing in
the world to cleanse this channel even by the use
of the enema; for the ancient contents refuse dislodgment
even after repeated flushings, and it is
only after many days of persistent and patient irrigation
that the intestines are freed.</p>

<p>Some persons are apprehensive as to the quantity
of water the large intestine will hold with<span class="pagenum" title="107"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a></span>
safety. Let me reassure them. It is capable of
holding about three gallons without too great distention.
One-third of this amount, however, is
quite sufficient to bring away the accumulated fecal
mass, and in many cases a much smaller amount
will answer the purpose&mdash;especially when, as advised,
it is used two or three times within twenty-four
hours. After a thorough evacuation, water
should be injected one or more times until it returns
clear and free from fragments of feces.</p>

<p>If I were asked to name the greatest curse
parents could inflict upon their helpless offspring,
I would say <i>fecal auto-intoxication</i>. A large
volume could be written on the subject, and I trust
the hints here given will lead to discussion of this
grave matter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

<span class="smcap">Objections to the Use of the Enema Answered.</span></h2>


<p>The privilege of raising objections belongs to
the ignorant as well as to the intelligent. But
the objector is under as great obligations to state
his reasons as the advocate.</p>

<p>The first plausible objection to the use of the
enema is that it is not natural.</p>

<p>Admitting this charge, I would say that, inasmuch
as proctitis, colitis, and con­sti­pa­tion are unnatural,
the use of a preternatural or, in other
words, a rational means to overcome the consequences
of these diseases is imperative. The
enema is such a means.</p>

<p>Can any one that suffers from proctitis, etc.,
have a natural stool? Unnatural conditions require
preternatural aids, as we all know. The injected
water dilates the constricted portion of the gut and
arouses a revulsive impulse to expel the invading
water. In obeying this impulse, the imprisoned
feces, gases, etc., are ejected with the water.</p>

<p>It may be unnatural to put water into the rectum,
etc., but once there its expulsion from healthy
bowels would be quite natural. No natural action
can be expected from unhealthy bowels; they do<span class="pagenum" title="109"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a></span>
the best they can under the circum­stances. Eyeglasses,
false teeth, crutches, etc., are unnatural
but invaluable aids, but no more so than is the
enema as a means of relief from overloaded bowels.
The enema, moreover, be it noted, not only aids
the system by relieving it of its load: it cleanses
and soothes an organ that must keep at work
and perform its function even when invaded by
disease.</p>

<p>Surely it is unhygienic and irrational to ignore
the valuable service of the enema in cases in which
the bowels are in an unnatural condition.</p>

<p>The second objection is that the water will wash
away the mucus from the mucous membrane of
the bowels and leave them dry and parched and
thus apt to crack and break in two. I would remind
the objector that, since about seventy-five per
cent. of the normal feces is water, it seems strange
that so great a quantity of water in contact with
the mucous surface of the bowels should not also
cause dryness.</p>

<p>The integument of the body and that of the
mucous membrane are similar in structure, yet who
ever had a fear of producing dryness of the skin by
much application of water? The mucous membrane
is simply the skin turned inward; and since
it is much more vascular it is less apt to become
dry&mdash;if, indeed, its dryness were at all possible.
The objector should also remember that the body
is composed of over eighty per cent. of water&mdash;an
organism not to be made dry or parched by the<span class="pagenum" title="110"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a></span>
application of water to the skin or to the mucous
membrane two or three times a day.</p>

<p>The mucous membrane of the lower bowel is not
unlike that of the mouth, throat, or stomach. Do
you realize how often the upper end of the intestinal
canal is washed or bathed daily with liquids,&mdash;soft
and hard drinks, hot and cold,&mdash;especially by those
who have formed the drink habit instead of the
enema habit? They have no fear of drying the
mucous membrane thereby; but, if you can instill
this fear, they will increase the quantity with
pleasure!</p>

<p>This second objection, being the result of too
vivid an imagination and too little reflection, is a
very nonsensical objection indeed.</p>

<p>A third objection is that if you begin the use of
the enema you will have to continue its use; you
can’t stop, and, lo and behold! the enema habit is
formed,&mdash;a new habit in addition to the many
habits civilized man is already carrying: the con­sti­pated
habit, the physic habit, the sand, bran,
sawdust-food habit, the muscular peristaltic habit,
etc.,&mdash;and with all these habits the poor victim of
proctitis and intestinal foulness wonders that he is
alive.</p>

<p>Usually the first symptom of proctitis is con­sti­pa­tion,
and for relief the enema habit should be
formed and continued while the con­sti­pa­tion remains.
When the proper means are found to remove
the intestinal inflammation&mdash;proctitis and
colitis&mdash;then the con­sti­pa­tion will disappear, and<span class="pagenum" title="111"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a></span>
with its disappearance the enema habit can be discontinued.
But let it be well noted that the enema
is itself an aid in curing the cause, an aid superior
to any other at our command. A cleanly habit
ought not to be an objectionable one, especially in
cases in which it is most needed to prevent toxic
substances from entering the system.</p>

<p>A fourth objection is that after taking the first
enema the con­sti­pa­tion is worse.</p>

<p>With many persons a certain amount of undue
accumulation of feces will excite a sufficient muscular
effort of the gut to force the dried mass through
the proctitis- and colitis-strictured bowels. This
unnatural effort may occur once a day or once in
two or three days, and has doubtless been a habit
of many years’ duration.</p>

<p>To introduce a new order of conduct on the part
of the bowels requires time. If the bowels have
been in the habit of expelling feces in the morning,
and an enema were taken the night before, there
might be no desire to stool the next morning because
of the fact that the bulk or accumulated mass
of excrement was no longer there to create a vigorous
call or impulse for defecation.</p>

<p>But we have found the extent of local damage
and reflex injury to the organs, and more especially
we have found the constant absorption of poisons
into the system, due to the presence of feces. It
is for this reason that the elimination of feces twice
or thrice in twenty-four hours is advised. The
condition for which an enema is used is disturbing<span class="pagenum" title="112"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a></span>
and poisoning to the system. It is, therefore, a
most unnatural condition. What is more rational,
then, than to employ an “unnatural” yet not harmful
means to bring about a more normal condition,
one free from poisoning and irritating consequences?</p>

<p>A fifth objection is made by those who have as a
symptom of proctitis a large development of pile
tumors or hemorrhoids (distended mucous membrane).
The objection is that at times these tumors
or sacs prolapse very freely during the act of expelling
the injected water. But this prolapse occurs
in many cases whether water is used or not.</p>

<p>A certain amount of anal irritation caused by the
passage of feces occurs, causing contraction of the
circular muscular tissue that forms the anal and
rectal canal, also of the longitudinal muscular bands
and the levator muscles of the organs. The enema
lessens or entirely diminishes the irritation of passing
feces, and the natural result is that the serum-filled
sacs called piles and the tissue loosened by
the inflammatory product would more readily prolapse
during the act of defecating. It is simply a
choice between irritation of the stool keeping the
tissue up and no irritation permitting a prolapse.</p>

<p>Of course, if there be no expulsion of feces and
water the stretched or dilated sacs may keep their
places in the rectum. And then again the enema
may be used for quite a period, when all at once a
large prolapse of sacculated mucous membrane occurs,
and the enema is thought to be the cause of<span class="pagenum" title="113"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a></span>
it. That this is not the cause, let it be remembered
that in all cases of proctitis the chronic inflammation
is apt to become subacute or acute, and that
this intense engorgement and enlargement of the
tissue with blood and the increased fever in the
parts often result in prolapse at any time, especially
at times of convulsive effort at evacuation.</p>

<p>Whatever follows the proper use of an enema,
even though what follows be annoying, should not
be blamed on the enema, for its action is most
kindly, lessening, as it does, the irritation that otherwise
would be more severe when the feces pass
through a disease-constricted canal.</p>

<p>The sixth objection is that the use of the enema
will weaken the bowels, which are already too
“weak” to expel their contents. “Atony, paralysis,
fatty degeneration of the gut, are bad enough,” say
these objectors, “without having an enema increase
their uselessness.” Diagnosis wrong and objection
groundless!</p>

<p>Distend and contract an organ for a short time
two or three times a day, and it will gain in strength
from the exercise. Every one knows that this is
the case. What more gentle means of exercising
the large intestine than by the enema?</p>

<p>But the truth of the matter is, that in all cases of
proctitis and con­sti­pa­tion the diseased portion of
the gut is too active in its muscular movements,
contracting spasmodically, as it does, at even the
suggestion or suspicion of feces near it. Every
impulse of the bowels above the constricted section<span class="pagenum" title="114"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a></span>
to force the feces down through the closed bore
only intensifies the spasmodic action and increases
the muscular obstruction, compelling the victim to
resort to some one of the many drastic means of
relief.</p>

<p>The enema does no more than kindly to dilate
the constricted region, which, when dilated, evokes
a harmonious concerted action of all the nerves and
muscles to pass along and down the burden of
feces, which, without the aid of a flood of water,
they had been incapable of moving, and would have
had to leave to poison the system.</p>

<p>The seventh objection is quite <i>naïve</i>: “Inasmuch
as the Indians of this country had no use for the
enema, why should we resort to it?”</p>

<p>The all-sufficient answer to this objection is that
the Indians lived a natural life, while ours is artificial.
Much can be said on this point, but the reader is
surely rational enough to follow out the distinction
suggested. Our lives are much more important
than were the lives of the aborigines of this country,
and our “demands of Nature” are more exigent.
If your life is of no greater value than theirs, for
leisure’s sake don’t use the enema! You will be
taking too much trouble. It really should seem
that the cleanliness of the skin and mucous membrane,
the care we take of our bodies, is an indication
and measure of our sense of refinement. An
ancient Scripture hath it: “Let those that are filthy,
be filthy still.” It all depends upon how you wish
to be classed&mdash;with the filthy or the cleanly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="115"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a></span></p>

<p>The eighth objection to be noted is the fear of
“poking things” (points of instruments) “into the
rectum.”</p>

<p>This looks like a real objection. No healthy,
nor even unhealthy, organ, for that matter, should
be “abused.” And what seems more likely to cause
it trouble than to poke a hard- or soft-rubber point
or tube through its vent in opposition to its bent
or inclination? Still, the muscles of the vent are
strong, and they soon accommodate themselves to
the practice. Their slight disinclination is not to
be considered alongside of the relief and cure you
effectuate by the use of the enema.</p>

<p>Have no fear that the point will occasion disease
when intelligently used. Always see to it that the
point is scrupulously clean. Those made of hard
rubber or metal can be kept so without effort. Soft-rubber
points are always foul and dangerous, especially
after they are used a few times. A good
rule is never to put a point higher in the bowel
than is absolutely necessary.</p>

<p>The ninth objection seems serious. It is that
in taking an enema the water escaping from the
syringe point will injure the mucous membrane
where the jet strikes. But on examination this objection
falls to the ground; for it stands to reason
the jet cannot directly hit the surface for more than
a moment. Immediately thereafter the accumulation
of water will force the jet to spend its energy
on the increasing volume, to lift it out of the way
so that the continuous inflow may find room.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="116"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a></span></p>

<p>But even were it possible for the jet to strike a
definite section of the mucous membrane during the
taking of the enema, it could do no harm provided
the water be at the proper temperature. And this
is true even if a hydrant pressure be used. Not a
few persons use the hydrant pressure of their
houses in taking an enema. For a really successful
flushing of the colon a considerable pressure is
requisite to force the volume up and along a distance
of five feet, especially when sitting upright.
But it is folly to use a long syringe point, since it
is like introducing one canal into another for the
purpose of cleansing it. Therefore, have no fear
from the use of proper syringe points; the jet of
water will <i>not</i> hurt the mucous membrane. My
professional brethren at least ought to know that
the idea of such harm is sheer nonsense.</p>

<p>The tenth objection to using an enema is in
<i>being obliged to use it</i> from the fact of having such
a disease as chronic inflammation of the rectum
and colon. Every victim hates to be compelled to
do a thing; and the victim of proctitis and colitis
is no exception to the rule. In fact, he is
beginning to realize that unless he uses it his system
will be poisoned by the absorption of the
sewage waste. Let the victim object to the disease
that necessitates the use of the enema, and all
will shortly be well. Then this objection to the
use of the enema will indeed be the most important
of all.</p>

<p>The eleventh objection, and the most ridiculous<span class="pagenum" title="117"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a></span>
of all, is that it requires too much time to take the
enema twice or thrice daily.</p>

<p>I lose all patience with persons urging this objection.
Those that have little or no system with
their daily duties seldom have time to do anything
of importance. They suffer from “haphazarditis,”
a very difficult disease to cure, and they are in
many cases hopeless. Usually they are an uncleanly
lot of people, full of good intentions, but
their intentions, though taken often, seldom operate
as an antidote to foulness. Their one sigh the
livelong day is: “Oh, could we be like birds that
can stool while on the wing or on foot!” This
feat of time-saving being hardly possible in the
present incarnation and order of society, they content
themselves with making a storehouse out of
the intestinal canal for an indefinite length of time
as they concern themselves with external affairs of
work or sport. A sorry lot they are, indeed, when
they are laid up for repairs! Many doctors, I am
sorry to say, encourage, with a chuckle, this foolish
practice. “Any time to stool you can manage to
get, so that you stool at least once a day, or once
in every two or three days; stool when it is normal
for you to do so.” This criminal advice just suits
the sleepy, the lazy, or the “awfully busy.”</p>

<p>The American habit of doing things <i>en masse</i>, of
handling things in large quantities or in bulk, has
something to do with their don’t-care con­sti­pated
habit. Small evacuations two or three times a day
seem too much like small business, which of course<span class="pagenum" title="118"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a></span>
is a waste of precious time. Wholesaling, laziness,
lack of system, hurry, are the cause of good-for-nothingness
of body and mind. It should never be
too much trouble to restore the lost impulse for
stooling twice or thrice daily.</p>

<p>Is it a small matter to have the main sewer of a
city partly or entirely closed, or the main sewer
pipe of a dwelling stopped up? Think of the dire
results, not­with­stand­ing that the windows and doors
remain wide open! The Board of Health would
soon deal with the negligent official or landlord.
With very few exceptions, “civilized” men, women,
and children are negligent and niggardly caretakers
of the human dwelling-place&mdash;the marvelous
body of man. “Lack of time,” “haven’t the
time,” or “no time,” is the excuse they give themselves
and others.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the numberless victims around
them, none of these negligent and niggardly ones
seem to get alarmed until the secondary symptoms&mdash;such
as indigestion, gout, rheumatism, or disease
of some vital organ&mdash;are sufficiently annoying to
demand attention. But I have full faith in humanity.
Man does the best he knows how&mdash;as a
general rule. But often he doesn’t know how; he
needs enlightening.</p>

<p>The hints I have given will, I am confident, be
considered and acted upon by all to whose attention
they are brought, for, by acting upon them, normal
bodies and minds will result, and blessings
attained heretofore considered impossible. Normal<span class="pagenum" title="119"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a></span>
health depends on right doing and being. Eternal
vigilance is the price to be paid for the attainment
and maintenance of the goal of normal life and progress.
Eliminate all waste material from the body
and all shifty vermin from the mind, and the millennium
for all things in the universe will soon dawn.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />

<span class="smcap">Lame Back.</span></h2>


<p>The manufacturers of various compounds advertised
in our daily newspapers and on the billboards
usually select very common ailments or
symptoms on which to exploit the merits of their
product. They make no distinction between a disease
and its symptoms; and why should they, when
their sole object is to sell their goods?</p>

<p>Lame back is a common weakness of that portion
of the spine usually spoken of as the “small
of the back.” As a general rule, it is an indication
of some pelvic disease involving the anus, rectum,
colon, bladder, or uterus. Those who suffer from
disease of one or more of the pelvic organs will
have at times reminders that they have a lame,
weak, or “dead” spot at the “small of the back”
or a little lower down on the spine.</p>

<p>As an illustration, a current advertisement reads
as follows: “Weak Backs! If you happen to be
one of those unfortunate people with a weak, lame,
tired, aching back, it is time you were finding out
about &mdash;&mdash;.” Then the advertisement proceeds to
tell how to put on a plaster or a liniment, or rub
the back for a week or two with the hands. Another<span class="pagenum" title="122"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a></span>
enterprising wonder-worker asks: “Do you
get up with a lame back? Thousands of women
have kidney trouble and never suspect it.” “Lifted
from the depths of despair by &mdash;&mdash;” etc. Now, this
may be seriously alarming
to actual sufferers
from lame back.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 400px;">
<a id="Fig_19"></a>
<img src="images/i_p122.jpg" width="230" height="293" alt="" />

<p>Showing the distribution of the sympathetic
nerve about the rectum. 22,
the rectum; 23, the bladder; 26, the
kidney; 20, the rectal plexus; 19, the
vesicle plexus; 18, the sacral ganglia;
21, the lumbar plexus; the lumbar
ganglia; 16, the mesenteric plexus; 15,
the solar plexus; 27, the aorta.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The kidneys are located
several inches
above the region called
the “small of the back”;
therefore, a difficulty in
this region does not
necessarily indicate disease
of the kidneys.
Those who suffer from
the symptoms described&mdash;lame,
weak,
hot, dead spots, lumbago,
rheumatism, etc.&mdash;at
this portion of the
spine may suspect that
some of the organs in
what is called the pelvic
cavity are causing them. The spinal nerves
(lumbar nerves) on leaving the “small of the back”
and proceeding lower down are distributed to the
anus, rectum, bladder, uterus, etc., and when one
or more of these organs are diseased the victim
will have some of the symptoms in the portion of
the back mentioned above. The earlier indica­tions<span class="pagenum" title="123"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a></span>
of a disease are usually localized, but, as the
malady itself persists indefinitely, both the sufferer
and his physician are often deceived as to the producing
cause of the varying symptoms manifesting
throughout the body.</p>

<p>In this brief chapter I will confine myself to the
diseases of the anus, rectum, and colon, as causing
so much annoyance from the symptoms enumerated
at or below the “small of the back.” The most
common ailment that afflicts mankind is chronic
catarrhal inflammation of the anus, rectum, and
colon. The disease invades not only the mucous
membrane but the whole bowel structure, and the
nerves report from the seat of the trouble up to
where they enter the spinal column&mdash;a region that
should be called the porous-plaster region rather
than the “small of the back.”</p>

<p>The chronic inflammation involving eight to ten
inches of the lower portion of the intestinal canal,
like all other diseases, has its alternating periods of
quietude and excitement; and the negligent sufferer
must count on having “stitches in the back,”&mdash;cold
in the back, lumbago, rheumatism, sciatica,
etc., as they are usually called for want of a definite
idea as to the <i>cause</i> of the annoying symptoms.
The physician consulted usually agrees with the
sufferer’s diagnosis, and coincides with the application
of bands, porous plasters, liniments, etc.&mdash;which
may allay the neuralgic symptoms to some extent.</p>

<p>The reader is so familiar with illustrations in the
newspapers and on bill-boards of a man with a<span class="pagenum" title="124"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a></span>
weak or lame back that it is unnecessary here to
take up space with a pen picture descriptive of the
symptoms and attitudes of a sufferer.</p>

<p>Those who have had occasion to acquire the
warm-band, the rubbing with liniment, and the
plaster habits, had better direct their attention and
remedies to the <i>cause</i> of the symptoms. One frequent
source of all these back symptoms is chronic
inflammation of the anus, rectum, and colon, with
more or less ulceration accompanying it. In the
female, disease of the uterus complicates the painful
symptoms. Usually among the first indications
of this disease is some degree of con­sti­pa­tion, which
in time is followed by local symptoms known as
piles, fissure, itching tabs, clot of blood in a vein,
abscess, etc. Constipation is a prolific cause of
indigestion, biliousness, flatulency, loss of appetite,
self-poisoning, anemia, emaciation, uric acid, neuralgia
in various parts of the system, catarrhal inflammation
of the mucous membrane of one or
more organs, and many other symptoms.</p>

<p>A diseased organ is a constant source of unconscious
and conscious irritation to the sufferer. If
the victim can tolerate the trouble he seldom seeks
treatment. “I will not bother with it as long as it
is no worse,” he says. At times, however, the symptoms
become very annoying, and measures are
taken to allay them. During the long interval of
“better and worse” effects the malady is becoming
more deeply seated, and the symptoms eventually
appear in all parts of the body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="125"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a></span></p>

<p>As a rule, the majority of victims put off treatment
until a protracted period of extreme suffering
or the fear of a fatal ending compels them to consult
a physician&mdash;who labors at a great disadvantage
in seeking to effect a cure on account of the
long neglect.</p>

<p>Severe symptoms located at the porous-plaster
region of the spine, when brought on by disease of
the lower bowel, usually indicate an acute stage of
chronic inflammation and retention of feces and
gases in the sigmoid flexure and colon. Acute or
subacute inflammation and fever and pressure of
the feces are more than the long-abused nerves can
endure, and severe pain is the result.</p>

<p>Then the sufferer has something to say about
his back, and what is best to do for it.</p>

<p>The logical course is to unload the bowels of
feces and gases by a generous use of the enema
and to treat the diseased tissues kindly. The symptoms
will soon disappear when the cause is removed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />

<span class="smcap">Uric Acid.</span></h2>


<p>A society leader, in speaking of her ills to a
woman friend, said: “I am ‘lousy’ with uric
acid.” From infancy to old age, mankind is more
or less filled with uric acid and other poisons&mdash;the
result of a foul intestinal canal. Poisoned blood is
a common symptom, and it arises from an almost
universal cause&mdash;chronic con­sti­pa­tion. So universal
is con­sti­pa­tion of the bowels in illness that it is
the first duty of a physician to prescribe some
remedy to unload them.</p>

<p>It is said that a Boston doctor, whose practice
was largely among the wealthy classes, used to say:
“There is no use in physicians pretending to be
anything else&mdash;they always smell of rhubarb.” And
in an address to a class of medical students an old
doctor once said that he and his associate practitioners
had found that calomel and opium filled
every want in the ills they were called upon to
treat.</p>

<p>For ages all mankind has striven to find a remedy
effectively to clean the intestinal tract. Pills, powders,
tablets, wafers, suppositories, salts, teas, candies,
and syrups have been administered&mdash;all with<span class="pagenum" title="127"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a></span>
that sole purpose. Efforts have been made to
accomplish this object by utilizing every possible
device and contrivance known to human ingenuity.
Calisthenics, massage, physical-culture exercise,
mental therapy, horseback riding, “dieting,” fasting&mdash;these
are some of the many means resorted
to in order to “sterilize” the foul, con­sti­pated intestinal
canal.</p>

<p>Albeit that the cleaning of the digestive apparatus
in the case of a sick person is regarded as
a necessary first help the world over, few persons
realize that it is of equal importance in the case of
a seemingly healthy person. Is it not a fair inference,
therefore, that where a purgative&mdash;such as
calomel, or one of the innumerable similarly-acting
medicines&mdash;temporarily relieves a patient’s symptoms,
the timely precaution of keeping the intestinal
canal and system clean would prevent a person
from getting ill?</p>

<p>The reader may think that, in these observations,
I have wandered away from my text, but, as uric
acid is the <i>symptom</i> of a combination and complication
of disorders of which con­sti­pa­tion is the secondary
cause, the connection and sequence of my
remarks are evident. It is safe for a layman to
assume that, where so many diverse schemes are
employed to relieve symptoms, the diagnosis is
wrong&mdash;also the treatment.</p>

<p>A few of the many primary symptoms of proctitis
and colitis are con­sti­pa­tion, diarrhea, indigestion,
biliousness, flatulency, putre­fac­tion, and<span class="pagenum" title="128"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a></span>
gaseous and bacterial poisons&mdash;a foul gastro-intestinal
canal, through which there are daily absorbed
from the bowels two-thirds to three-fourths of the
excrementitious matter into the system. With
these facts before us we need not be astonished
at the statement that nine-tenths of human ills
have their origin in the digestive apparatus.</p>

<p>Among the secondary symptoms of proctitis
and colitis is poisoned blood&mdash;anemia, which is
usually followed by impaired nutrition and emaciation
or obesity. Along with the changes in the
blood and nutrition there occurs lodgment or deposit
of salts, acids, etc., in the various organs and
tissues of the body. Almost every one is familiar
with gouty deposits in the finger joints and other
joints of the body. If the deposits occur in the
muscular tissue it is called rheumatism. If in the
urinary organs we have gravel, Bright’s disease,
diabetes, cystitis, irritation of the neck of the bladder,
frequent calls to urinate; and the urine, scanty
and high-colored, on cooling reveals a crystalline
deposit. The principal mineral substances of the
urine are as follows&mdash;of which one or more may
become poisonous: chloride of potassium, chloride
of calcium, chloride of magnesium, chloride of sodium,
sulphate of potassium, sulphate of soda, sulphate
of magnesia, phosphate of soda, and phosphate
of potassium.</p>

<p>The liver gets its share of the foul substances
generated in the intestinal canal, which cause congestion
of the organ. Toxic biliary salts and<span class="pagenum" title="129"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a></span>
acids are present. The deposit may form gall-stones,
and jaundice and many other annoying
symptoms may occur. The system is simply a
filter, or blotter, that lets the poisonous contents of
the intestinal canal pass through and out; but all
the organs and tissues, during the process, retain
many of the foreign toxic substances, which overtax
(and frequently destroy) their functions with
work that Nature never intended they should do.
Think of it&mdash;all the organs and tissues around the
intestinal canal serving as <i>fecal vents</i>! Deposits
cause irritation of nerve centers and nerve cells
precisely as in fibrous and cartilaginous tissues;
and we speak of the symptoms as spinal irritation,
hysteria, chorea, lumbago, sciatica, nervous tension,
headache, irritability, despondency, melancholia,
insomnia, dementia, etc. From the disturbance of
the voluntary and involuntary nerves we have irregular
circulation of the blood from disturbed
heart action, cold hands and feet, and flushing of
the face alternating with pallor, vertigo, and dizziness.
The capillary circulation becomes obstructed
with crystallized bodies, as chunks of ice obstruct a
stream of water.</p>

<p>Catarrhal inflammation of the mucous membrane
is set up in various parts of the body by the deposits
in the membrane and the abnormal means
of their elimination through it. The skin of the
body, which is the mucous membrane turned outward,
suffers likewise from diseases having numerous
names.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="130"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a></span></p>

<p>Doctors have always expressed a poor opinion
of the liver because it did not keep the bowels
sweet and clean, and they mistakenly though honestly
called it “the lazy liver,” “the torpid liver,”
“hepatic insufficiency,” “atony of the liver,” “sluggish
liver,” “hepatic torpor,” “fatty liver,” etc.; and
the poor victim of proctitis and colitis was glad he
had consulted the doctor and learned “just the
cause” of his internal troubles&mdash;and could suffer
on more reconciled to his malady since he knew its
exact name and could continue to take with regularity
one or more of the many powerful liver exciters,
to stimulate activity in the liver and bowels
once every day or two, if possible. By some strange
psychological or other influence of late years, however,
physicians have turned their attention to the
“lazy kidneys,” and now it is difficult to decide
which they are purging the most&mdash;the liver or the
kidneys. At any rate, they both must be violently
excited at the same time, and we hear “lithia” mentioned,
or “laxative salts of lithia,” every time uric
acid is thought of. Stimulate the lazy liver and
kidneys, and with abundant salts dissolve out of the
tissues and blood the precipitated deposits; this is
the fashion of the times.</p>

<p>Diagnosis wrong and treatment harmful! Water
is by far the best agent to dissolve salt compounds,
to dilute acids, or to remove filth. It is also
the best means of soothing and relieving the long
irritated and inflamed tissues and organs, that have
had from two-thirds to three-fourths of the daily<span class="pagenum" title="131"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a></span>
fecal mass thrust upon them and collected in them,
when they are called torpid, lazy, and whipped up
unmercifully by bile and urine bouncers. We ourselves
would be very torpid, sluggish, or “lazy” if
called upon to do the work of two persons under
such embarrassing physiological circum­stances as
being filled with toxic substances, or thoroughly
auto-intoxicated.</p>

<p>When will common sense take the place of
theories founded on guesswork, and some thorough
washing out by plain or distilled water be done,
internally as well as externally? After such an
operation some specific remedy may be taken, if
demanded, with the certainty of permanent good
resulting. But remember, your aqueous body, held
in its form by the skin and mucous membrane,
needs a well-nigh constant stream of pure water
flowing through it to keep it fresh and clean.</p>

<p>The diagnostic error of mistaking effect for cause,
however, is frequently made. Patients are treated
for one of the secondary symptoms&mdash;say uric acid&mdash;with
a view to abate that disorder and restore
health, when treatment for the specific cause of
con­sti­pa­tion&mdash;proctitis (inflammation of the anus
and rectum)&mdash;would restore the patient to his normal
vigor. Pale, anemic sufferers from con­sti­pa­tion
are often told that the restoration of their
blood to its normal state will effect a complete
cure. No idea could be further amiss, for if the
poisoned victims take coal oil, fish oil, malt compounds,
iron, etc., as tonics, into a disordered<span class="pagenum" title="132"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a></span>
stomach and unclean bowels, how can anything
more than imaginary relief be obtained? Is it not
evident that the chief disorder, <i>proctitis</i>, the main
cause of the trouble, has in no way been reached?</p>

<p>In other complications arising from con­sti­pa­tion,
a favorite diagnosis is one of the secondary symptoms&mdash;“atony”
of the bowels, liver, or kidneys.
In these cases nux vomica and various poisonous
compounds are given, but here also it stands to
reason that the administering of remedies for symptoms
cannot effect a cure of a chronic local disease
of the anus, rectum, or colon. Then, again, by
way of variety, a diagnosis of “uric acid” is made
for which irritant drugs are administered to increase
the eliminating or excretory action of the
bowels and kidneys. It is utter folly and absurdity
to attempt the cleansing of the intestinal tract
by laxatives, cathartics, purgatives, exercise, etc.,
and to make the kidneys and liver, overtaxed
from foul bowel products, do still more work by
giving medicines to increase the urinal and biliary
secretions.</p>

<p>It does not require a knowledge of the principles
of physiology and pathology to know that no sufferer
from chronic con­sti­pa­tion can be permanently
benefited if any or all of the secondary symptoms
already noted be treated with the usual list of drugs
and the cause ignored.</p>

<p>Much stress is laid upon the quantity and quality
of food consumed by most people, and many generalizers
attribute chronic con­sti­pa­tion, uric acid,<span class="pagenum" title="133"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a></span>
etc., to this very thing. Surely the average person
knows that too much or too little food taken at
regular intervals is not conducive to good health&mdash;a
view that I have found borne out by a large
majority of my patients, who rarely overstepped
the limits and knew when a diminution in the
supply of nourishment was advisable.</p>

<p>In the last analysis, the principal cause of ill
health is lack of elimination of the excretory organs.
When the bowels fail to do their proper
work, the functions of the other organs of the body
become correspondingly affected and impaired, and
general debility ensues.</p>

<p>In previous chapters, also in my book, <i>Intestinal
Ills</i>, I have made plain the causes contributing to
chronic con­sti­pa­tion and the use of enemas and
their origin. <i>Prehension</i> and <i>elimination</i> are two
subjects that are vital to the welfare of man. If
the eliminating power of the intestinal canal is
normally active, the fortunate individual may eat
abundantly, or really in excess of the requirements
of the system, and still escape any ill effects, such
as indigestion, biliousness, acid in the urine, etc.
The hearty consumer of food whose bowels eliminate
properly may suffer a loss of appetite, but it
will not be accompanied with foulness of the digestive
apparatus.</p>

<p>When all the organs of the body perform their
functions in a normal manner, no part of the structure
is in immediate need of repair. Every organ
whose function consists in building tissues, muscles,<span class="pagenum" title="134"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a></span>
or some other part of the body, having a sufficient
supply of reserve nutriment on hand, makes known
this state throughout the organism; hence there
is no craving for food, no appetite, although the
tongue, stomach, and intestines are in a normal
condition. In this state of surplus of nourishment
the person may omit a few meals or partake sparingly
until the expenditure is equal to the income.
But such physiological happiness is not for the person
whose intestinal canal and system are clogged
and foul from undue retention of excrementitious
material, causing no desire for food, while all the
atomic builders of the body are wanting nourishment
and protesting through the nervous system
against their impoverished condition.</p>

<p>Sufferers from self-poisoning, as described in this
chapter, should irrigate the system thoroughly by
frequent drinking and by copious injections of
water into the bowels. The action of the enema
if properly given and the drinking of water that

<p>Irrigation of the bowels for fifty minutes or
more with hot water (120 to 125 degrees) increases
the action of the kidneys. Hot irrigation (125 to
135 degrees) is especially recommended to increase
the discharge of urine and the action of the skin,
and should be continued for sixty minutes or more.

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />

<span class="smcap">Rational Sanitation and Hygiene.</span></h2>


<p>We, all of us, like to use things; indulgence is
enjoyable, but it generally ends with the
day. Few of us “take thought of the morrow.”
Neglecting, as we do, the <i>instruments</i> of use, their
availability for permanent subservience to our
wants steadily diminishes, becoming finally lost.
Is it that we do not know any better, or is it that
we are really so intoxicated with the Present that we
simply ignore the well-known claims of the Permanent?
Whatever the explanation may be, it is
nevertheless passing strange that little or no care
is bestowed on either our external or internal servitors,
instruments, or organs, which otherwise are
ever ready to keep us well filled with the pure wine
of joy. Perhaps it is that many of us find Nature
so lavish in supplying us with the means of joy that
we are naturally equally lavish in wasting them.
True economy&mdash;that is, the conserving of means
for their effective use&mdash;is yet to be learned by man.
Especially is this the case with our interior means,
our flesh, blood, nerves, vital force, etc. Nature
seems so ready to recoup and renew the organic
loss incurred by our use or indulgence&mdash;recuperation<span class="pagenum" title="137"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a></span>
seems so easy&mdash;that we simply grow careless,
reckless, prodigal, and before we are fairly aware
of it the disintegrative process gains an ascendency
over the restorative, and thenceforward our time
will be spent in endeavoring to cure what might
have been kept whole or well.</p>

<p>Nor is it an organ of the body here and there
that we neglect or abuse; it is more especially the
entire system of organs called “the body.” The
body is the organ of man’s spirit. We give no
heed to its tones; perhaps we have never caught
its rhythm; certain it is that when but a short time
in our perverted hands its chords are more or less
jangled, and a minor part is played in the grand
symphony of life.</p>

<p>The organ of man’s spirit! How rational, nay,
how necessary, it would seem to be to keep that
instrument keyed to its perfect work!</p>

<p>But the ordinary denizen of civilization has a
most ridiculous ideal of physical capability, namely,
that the savage&mdash;a being altogether “physical”&mdash;was
able to retain a healthy body till ripe old age
without attention either to sanitary surroundings
or to the hygienic functioning of his system of organs.
The “civilizee’s” fancy picture of the noble
savage is not based upon verifiable fact. It is true
that we have a few attractive myths concerning
savages that had survived appalling hardship; but
we are just learning of the innumerable host that
have perished periodically of various contagious
diseases, and of the countless number (infants,<span class="pagenum" title="138"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a></span>
youths, and adults) that have suffered from all
sorts of ailments. Alas! how little we know&mdash;or,
for that matter, how little we seem to care&mdash;of
the great multitude of “civilized” fellow-creatures
whose lives are all jangled and out of tune through
subjection to the many ills that flesh seems heir to;
ills that have arisen through either ignorance or
the voluntary <i>ignoring of the light of accessible
knowledge</i>!</p>

<p>In another aspect the human race is like an army
that concerns itself with its immediate and imperative
duties and has no time or thought to bestow
on those that fall out of the ranks. But slaves to
stern duty offend against Nature’s normality as do
slaves to desire; and the former little suspect that
their retirement also is near at hand. In health we
seldom or never think of the conditions for the
maintenance of health. That these conditions
should receive our prime attention is obvious when
we contemplate for a moment (1) our race of invalids,
and (2) the growing unsanitary condition of
modern industrialism, involving, as industrialism
perforce must, the unsanitary life of the factory,
workshop, office, and hothouse home.</p>

<p>Again, with the advance of high-pressure civilization
and culture human beings are developing a
more highly sensitive physical organism, pitched
to finer issues. How urgent the necessity for a
greater safeguarding of that organism!</p>

<p>If it be claimed that many of us do live up to
our knowledge of health conditions, and that we<span class="pagenum" title="139"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a></span>
are not­with­stand­ing unwell, I would answer that our
knowledge now is very disconnected, and that when
the time shall come that our itemistic information
shall have coalesced and formed a system of principles,
we will then have trustworthy rules for the
acquisition of health habits and become completely
normal physical beings. At present most of us are
intemperate in one or more ways. We eat too
much or too little&mdash;too rich or too poor food. So
it is with our drinking, our sleeping, our sporting,
our enjoyment of this or that excitement&mdash;the
quantity or the quality of each of these is not
well adapted or proportioned to the conditions of
normality.</p>

<p>Let me offer the health-seeker a few indications
of the sanitary and hygienic requirements demanded
by Nature’s normality. In our family and household
life, to carry into execution daily hygienic
measures, it is essential that we have ample, accessible
conveniences for the necessary ablution of the
body, externally and internally. How extremely
rare it is, however, that bath-tubs and water-closets
are found in sufficient quantity and suitable quality
in our apartments. As household fixtures they are
usually about as scarce as hens’ teeth.</p>

<p>In New York City a house with from eight to
sixteen persons is restricted to the use of one water-closet
and one bath-tub. On these (and a laundry
and servants’ privy in the basement) there is the
tax of ten dollars a year. Now, should that rare
human product, an enlightened and humane owner,<span class="pagenum" title="140"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a></span>
put in eight more bath-tubs and water-closets for
the proper accommodation of his sixteen guests, so
that each suite of sleeping apartments should have
its appropriate conveniences, he would have to pay
an additional tax of forty dollars a year. Is this
tax levied with the connivance of the Board of
Health? It would seem so, since no protest from
that august body has ever been heard within the
memory of the oldest inhabitant. Indeed, the suspicion
is not at all unwarranted that if the masses
were less con­sti­pated and better washed they would
have less use for the doctors, and that, therefore,
it is not well to encourage undue sanitation and
hygiene.</p>

<p>It must be, too, that the Department of Water
Supply has figured it out quite beautifully that a
saving will be insured in the amount of water consumed
by sixteen persons if they be restricted to
one bath-tub and one water-closet; otherwise forty
dollars a year would not be charged for eight additional
tubs and closets for the use of the same
number of persons. Listen to a sample of their
logic: “Sixteen persons with eight additional bath-tubs
and water-closets would use more water than
if they were restricted to one of each&mdash;hence
the additional tax. We don’t care a continental
whether these human beings are clean externally
or internally; that’s not our lookout. But we do
care that they shouldn’t use more water than just
so much, see!”</p>

<p>And does the august Board of Health raise the<span class="pagenum" title="141"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a></span>
least objection to this sort of logic? None whatever.</p>

<p>Professor C.&nbsp;S. Smith states that, out of 255,000
families in tenement-houses in the city of New
York, only 306 had access to bath-tubs in their own
homes in 1894. In 1897 one city block containing
904 families did not have a single bath-tub.</p>

<p>Paradoxical as it may seem, there is, not­with­stand­ing
the appropriation every year for the New York
City Board of Health of over one million dollars, a
prohibitive tax on bath-tubs and water-closets&mdash;that
is, on cleanliness&mdash;prohibitive on all homes except
those of the wealthy. Is it to be wondered at that
contagious diseases are prevalent, especially during
the winter months, and that we have so many acute
and chronic maladies?</p>

<p>Let me make a suggestion here for the serious
con­sid­er­ation of our city fathers: Reduce the appropriation
for the Board of Health to two hundred
thousand and give the other eight hundred thousand
to the Department of Water Supply, so as to
abolish the tax on water-closets and bath-tubs. If
every citizen of New York could have all the water
he needed for cleanliness and comfort, there would
be little excuse for the existence of such a body as
the Board of Health; its existence would then be
more honorable than onerous. Furthermore, the
city, as a corporate body, should manufacture bath-tubs
and water-closets, and furnish them at cost.
Thus would it insure a great stride toward the
health of its own citizens. When the disease-producing<span class="pagenum" title="142"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a></span>
microbe becomes scarce, the occupation of
the Health Board pathologist will be gone. Hold!
Could he not devote his time profitably to studying
the habits of health-producing microbes&mdash;for there
<i>are</i> such? Microbes are absolutely necessary for
higher forms of existence, it being now well known
that some microbes are destructive or pathological
and that others are constructive or physiological.
Is it not much wiser to spend our millions of dollars
for the prevention of disease than for quarantining
it? Inducing, and even compelling, people
to be clean is a far better policy than to compel
them to be vaccinated.</p>

<p>Now, we pay the Board of Health many thousands
of dollars a year simply for making cultures
of disease-producing bacteria so that antidotes may
be found. The pictures and history of these bacteria
are published in many large volumes, costing
the city several hundred thousand dollars a year.
Scientific as this practice undoubtedly is, it is very
expensive&mdash;and needless.</p>

<p>Every year thousands of children and invalids of
New York receive improper nourishment, or are
made positively sick, on milk that is either foul,
stale, or ready to sour; and every summer thousands
of children die from complaints traceable to
this source. Swill milk is one of the great generators
of disease-producing germs to which all sorts
of “complaints” are due. Does the Board of
Health care a fig for the generator? No; the
Board is absorbed in watching the antics of the<span class="pagenum" title="143"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a></span>
germs! Mighty intellects are searching for malignant,
multitudinous mites. Yet there are just a
few mites of common sense in existence, which if
encouraged will breed quite as fast as the sinister
ones. Indeed, there must be one or two at work
in myself, for I seem to be urged to say that if our
City and State Boards of Health should see to it
that our cows are kept clean and healthy, our milk
clean and pure, our cans clean and well scoured,
and our shops and ice-boxes clean and free from
odor, there would be no occasion for germ cultures
of diseases brought on by swill milk.</p>

<p>Our milk example will illustrate what germs of
common sense would do to ward off all kinds
of disease-producing micro-organisms. Rigorous
regulations, well enforced, as indicated above, would
work in other lines as well. And when the source
is gone sinister microbes will not come into existence,
and diseases that have resulted from such
microbes will have gone into innocuous desuetude.</p>

<p>There should be a bath-tub and a water-closet in
every suite of sleeping apartments. When this is
the case, there will be a larger number of persons
clean internally and externally, and the doctors
will be on a hunt for health-producing germs instead
of disease-producing ones. Let us start an
organized movement in this direction.</p>

<p>Last summer Medical Science went about killing
mosquitoes on Staten Island with a little spraying
apparatus, and managed to disturb the pest for a
day or two from its customary bivouac. Christian<span class="pagenum" title="144"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a></span>
Science stood aloof and smiled superciliously, claiming
that “there aren’t any such things as mosquitoes;
but if they should prove to exist, there isn’t
any malaria anyhow.” Good sense might have
suggested to Medicus the draining of the ponds for
gardening purposes; and, if that were not possible,
the filling in of the edges and the making of deep-water
lakes for the sport-loving youth, who might
be depended on to keep the water stirred up by
boating, etc., free of charge, and thus convert a
pest pond into a pleasure lake. Pleasure and
cleanliness are taxed to-day for disease and pests.
Oh, human imbecility!</p>

<p>As to public baths, there are so many objections
to them that I cannot touch on the subject in this
chapter. But let me impress upon the health-seeker,
the public-spirited citizen, and our city
officials that what we urgently need are ample
conveniences in our homes for internal and external
cleanliness&mdash;conveniences easily accessible several
times a day, every day of the year.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" title="145"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />

<span class="smcap">Personal Cleanliness.</span></h2>


<p>At the close of my last chapter I referred to the
ever-recurring problem of public baths. Annually
its agitation is renewed in lectures and
newspapers; public bathing is voted without disagreement
the thing of things needful to render the
laity&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, the labor population&mdash;physically pure.
It is the long-felt want; but, like the longed-for
walk of the annual Sunday-school parade, it is soon
done and gone. Still, we must have patience with
those dear souls, our ethical teachers of the press
and platform, for taking such a deep, sentimental,
though unscientific, interest in the welfare of the
unclean. Owing to the non-existence of home
facilities for cleanliness among the working class,
the accumulations of soil and exudation during the
long fall, winter, and spring months are so great
that their bodies become too rank and malodorous
for the nostrils of the refined. Consequently, as all
animals seek the tepid water of the summer, and as
man is no exception to a capacity for laving in the
circum­ambient fluid, to three-fourths of the population
of this metropolis it must be a glorious perennial
treat to dip in the river, bay, or sea; and it<span class="pagenum" title="146"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a></span>
must indeed be a dire necessity to those that have
managed to survive contagious and other diseases
during their long immurement. Without this summer
cleansing few animals, bestial or human, would
run half their average careers. It is accordingly
not strange that during the summer a bath in open
water is a daily hygienic necessity and source of
joy to thousands of creatures.</p>

<p>Now, it is just because godliness appears in the
wake of cleanliness that I made so strong a plea in
my last chapter for ample bath-tubs and water-closets.
For I do not approve, nay, I emphatically
condemn, the system of public baths along the
shores of our rivers and bay. Their waters are
contaminated by numerous sewers, and bathers
have contracted many contagious diseases that have
become epidemic in neighborhoods. Note especially
the annoying eye troubles that follow in the
wake of such bathing. Of course, the sport and
exercise involved in open-water bathing are highly
commendable; but the danger of contracting contagious
disease, and the outrage of the sense of
refinement when contemplating fellow-creatures
in the act of stirring up polluted waters, should
call a halt to our encouragement of public bathing
in and around our metropolitan water fronts.
These waters are surely anything but a means of
cleanliness.</p>

<p>The water-closet, however, is of far greater importance
than the bath-tub, and especially than the
public water-gymnasium&mdash;which last is so much<span class="pagenum" title="147"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a></span>
lauded by some of our misguided philanthropists.
Intestinal foulness, as a prolific source of disease, is
of far more serious importance than surface foulness.
However, both the bath-tub and the water-closet
are indispensable to every suite of rooms.</p>

<p>Another need imperatively demanded by the exigencies
of city life is the establishment of public
water-closets at several thousand convenient centers
throughout this great city. At present the
male population, when away from their residences,
are obliged to make use of a near-by saloon&mdash;a
most uncertain resort, and one in which courtesy
will generally constrain them to imbibe intoxicants
<i>nolens volens</i>. The female population have not
even the saloon as a resort, and can relieve themselves
only when in the vicinity of department
stores. American enterprise can improve in many
respects on the several European models of public-relief
stations. The public is becoming conscious
of its needs and rights in this respect; and
one of the sanitary evolutions of city life&mdash;congested
as it is&mdash;will be ample and cleanly public
accommodations for intestinal relief.</p>

<p>Americans in general suffer from dyspepsia, biliousness,
con­sti­pa­tion, uric acid, etc.&mdash;all of which
disorders are symptoms of that world-wide disease,
proctitis: inflammation of the anus, rectum, and
often the colon. Nor is it any wonder that unwashed
humanity suffers from proctitis and its consequences.
The unwashed have no bath-tubs and
practically no water-closets. This lack is due to<span class="pagenum" title="148"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148"></a></span>
the tax on water facilities, to expensive plumbing,
and to too much “science” and not enough common
sense among our city fathers. As a consequence
of ignorance and inconvenience, most people
defecate but once in twenty-four hours; and very
many but once in two or three days or a week.
The once-a-day stool is frequently scanty, and as a
consequence the kidneys, lungs, and skin are called
upon to perform the vicarious function of eliminating
a portion of the daily excrement; and the
colon and sigmoid flexure have to hold the stored
contents unduly&mdash;until the feces be expelled by
purgatives or by the irritation that the accumulated
mass occasions. Could the members of the
Board of Health and the people at large be brought
to a realizing sense of the value of personal cleanliness,&mdash;internal
as well as external,&mdash;bath-tubs and
water-closets would abound in our homes.</p>

<p>Man’s habits as to eating, drinking, dressing,
bathing, and especially as to defecating, are clues
to his growth in refinement. But we must beware
of judging a person by one or two good or bad
habits; he should be estimated by the sum of
his habits and their peculiar combination. Refined
habits are not all of them acquired at once; they
develop slowly, one after another, when opportunities
are favorable, especially the habits as to bathing
and defecating. Opportunities for these latter
are wofully lacking at present&mdash;the cause and consequences
of which lack are pointed out in the last
chapter. A child will derive far more good from a<span class="pagenum" title="149"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a></span>
ready access to bath-tub and water-closet than from
a lifelong attendance at Sunday-school and church
with the temple of the human soul permanently
unclean. Only one that has learned to respect
and care for the abode of the soul&mdash;the body&mdash;is
worthy of being classed among the refined. It is
truly deplorable that the great majority of the human
race are creatures of the moment or the hour,
tolerators of abnormal functioning, slow suicides of
vital capacities. Claims of the permanent are constantly
ignored; most of us are blind to the joy involved
in the harmonious functioning of all the
organs&mdash;a functioning that always ensues upon
hygienic care.</p>

<p>Our organs will for a time bear neglect or unhygienic
conditions without protesting their annoyance.
Many persons never use hot water or soap;
others find one bath, in river or sea, quite sufficient
for the year; others, again, feel the need of a bath
once or even twice a month, or even once a week.
But there are very few of us that seem to require a
bath daily. Many, alas! have grown accustomed
to a bathless existence.</p>

<p>Have you ever stood near an Italian or Greek
street vender, or have you ever been within five
feet of a low-class Polish Jew? If so, the stench
arising from his unwashed body must have nauseated
you. It is no secret that such persons never
wash&mdash;especially the latter, who live in rooms reeking
with filth. Contemplating such conditions, I
feel impelled to propose a great, nay, the greatest<span class="pagenum" title="150"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a></span>
reform&mdash;one suggested years ago by Samuel Butler
in <i>Erewhon</i>. Let us make Health the great civic
virtue, and Disease, as well as unsanitary and
unhygienic conditions, the crime. Our so-called
crimes of theft, murder, forgery, etc., should be
treated as weaknesses and faults to be corrected by
Moral Rectifiers&mdash;by the preachers, priests, rabbis,
and ethical culturists. Consider how much is implied
in developing and breeding a race of healthy
men and women. All relations of life would feel
the vital change at once, and moral weaknesses
would disappear. Any human cesspool entering a
public conveyance, or in any way mingling with
cleanly people, should be arrested, thoroughly
cleansed, internally and externally, and sequestered
for a time sufficient to teach him better.
There is a local rule of the Board of Health against
spitting, but it is rarely enforced. There are millions
of public expectorations to one arrest. For
the appearance in public of consumptives, and their
offensive hawking, coughing, and spitting, no one
seems to have suggested a remedy. All diseases
should be classified as to grades of punishment;
and all moral weaknesses, such as defalcations,
adultery, burglary, should be treated at the various
hospitals, which latter should be conducted solely
by Moral Rectifiers.</p>

<p>In closing, I shall direct attention to a few other
points in personal cleanliness&mdash;the mouth, ear, nose,
and throat.</p>

<p>It is important on hygienic grounds that the<span class="pagenum" title="151"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a></span>
mouth receive proper care two or three times
daily.</p>

<p>The ear is commonly kept clean; still there are
many instances of non-refinement of this organ,
and from its non-hygienic treatment deafness often
occurs.</p>

<p>The prevalent nasty, ill-bred habit of hawking
and spitting in public, or in company, even by genteel
persons, can be cured best by early training in
correct habits. This habit, as well as the evidences
of throat troubles, is usually to be ascribed to inattention
to the nose. When catarrhal conditions
are avoided or properly treated the throat will not
be so affected as to necessitate this reprehensible
practice. Trouble is invited for the tonsils and
soft palate by our constant hawking; certainly the
tender sensibility of the throat is destroyed thereby.
Inasmuch as the tobacco habit is so general, and spitting
is a necessary accompaniment of that habit,
stringent laws against hawking and spitting would
be unpopular among the masculine half of the race.
But should public opinion ever become educated
up to the point in which disease becomes a crime,
opposition would cease. This consummation is
devoutly to be wished, for then we will have
adopted and followed Ingersoll’s injunction to
“make health catching, not disease.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />

<span class="smcap">Hot Water in the Treatment of Proctitis
and Colitis.</span></h2>


<p>In treating chronic ulcerative inflammation of the
anus, rectum, sigmoid flexure, etc., it is well
to take advantage of every really practical device
to which one may have access, so that valuable
time may be saved in obtaining relief and effecting
a cure.</p>

<p>The capillaries, veins, arteries, and arterioles in
an inflamed organ become distended and the tissues
swollen, indurated, and tense by the excess of
blood and the inflammatory serum deposited in
the tissues. The vasomotor nerves in the diseased
part have lost their contractile power, which fact
increases the stasis, or congestion, of the blood.
Circulation in diseased tissue depends very much
on the general tone of the system, and if the circulation
is below the normal the ravage of the
malady is increased proportionally.</p>

<p>Have you ever observed a little stream of water
enter a large pond in which were grass, shrubbery,
logs, decaying vegetation, and débris of all sorts&mdash;the
accumulation of years? And have you noticed
that here and there there were stagnant pools,<span class="pagenum" title="153"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a></span>
without a perceptible motion from where you
stood, but that as you reached the side opposite to
the entrance some faint traces of motion became
visible, and that as you followed the line it soon
formed into a stream quite equal to the inflow?
The pure water, on entering and mingling with the
stagnant water and old deposits, soon becomes
corrupted and foul. Somewhat similar unhygienic
and toxic results take place in ponds of stagnant
blood and abnormal deposits such as proctitis and
colitis involve, and where, for six or eight inches
or more of the large intestine, inflammation is
deeply seated, and blood stasis is of course in full
swing. As the débris in a stagnant pond decays,
making the water impure, so in an inflamed organ
the tissues decay, making the blood impure. Ulceration
is an exhibition of this process of congestion,
induration, and decay.</p>

<p>The rectum and sigmoid flexure are loosely
hung in the pelvic space and are surrounded by
fatty cushions of connective tissue on all sides,
which fact allows the organ considerable dilatation
and motion (Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_5">5</a>). Owing to the anatomical
structure and the location of the lower bowel, it
becomes a serious matter when it is invaded by an
ulcerative inflammatory process&mdash;especially when
all the layers of tissue forming its wall are invaded,
and still more so when the connective tissue around
the organ is in the same condition.</p>

<p>Far better were it for the victim of proctitis
and peri­proc­titis&mdash;filled as he is with channels and<span class="pagenum" title="154"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a></span>
reservoirs&mdash;if pus were to form in abundance at
once and thus betray the destructive action in the
spongy areolar or connective tissue, under the mucous
membrane, around the rectum, and in the
tissue forming the anus and buttocks.</p>

<p>The pathological condition brought about by inflammation,
etc., requires a remedy that will empty
the over-dilated vessels and remove the serum deposit
in the tissues, which is analogous to the
rubbish of a pond.</p>

<p>Our grandmothers were familiar with the therapeutic
effects of heat and moisture when they
applied hot poultices constantly to an inflamed
organ or limb for one or more hours until the
tissues presented a blanched, shriveled, and white
appearance; if there were signs of the inflammation
returning, the poulticing was continued or
repeated. They knew very well what the parboiled
condition of a washerwoman’s hands indicated after
a day’s work in hot water. They were bloodless,
not­with­stand­ing their incessant muscular exercise.
In case of inflammation, they reasoned, heat and
moisture would make the congestion and fever
leave if applied long enough. On beginning the
use of the hot poultice, the tissues to which its
heat and moisture were applied became relaxed,
and the parts for the time more congested than
before; but our grandmothers did not mind that,
as the final result would justify their hydriatic procedure.
They well knew that after ten minutes or
more a reverse action would take place, and if the<span class="pagenum" title="155"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155"></a></span>
treatment were continued long enough the blood-vessels
and tissues would show little or no evidence
of fever or inflammation.</p>

<p>Where chronic inflammation exists, the blood-vessels
and tissues lose their normal tone or
vitality; consequently, they will require repeated
application of hot water as well as other aids until
a cure shall have been effected.</p>

<p>Another great advantage in the use of hot water
is that its application can be interrupted and resumed
without detriment to the diseased tissues or
organs. Cold water, on the contrary, causes the
vessels quickly to contract and expel the blood,
but, on reaction taking place, the tissues become
more congested than before.</p>

<p>In the use of water at a temperature of 120 to
135 degrees, or even more, we have one of the
most valuable adjuvants in all stages of proctitis
and colitis, and, if a properly regulated plan be
pursued in connection with the requisite local treatment,
more good can thus be accomplished than by
all other means combined.</p>

<p>The layman is more or less familiar with the
condition of a sore or ulcer in which soft, spongy,
or fungous tissues appear, called “proud flesh,”
which, on an inflamed mucous membrane, is called
granular tissue. Were it not for the usual presence
of granular tissue on a chronically inflamed mucous
membrane and for ulcerated sections or patches,
channels, and stretched or pouched mucous membrane
called piles, the proper use of hot water<span class="pagenum" title="156"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156"></a></span>
alone would in time effect a total cure in almost
every case of proctitis.</p>

<p>Many well-meaning persons conceive the idea
that, if hot water is so beneficial, they may use it
as hot as possible for the purpose of an enema
likewise, since they will thereby not only relieve
the bowels of their stored feces but simultaneously
do the inflamed tissues “a whole lot of good.”
Their spirit is admirable, for not all patients are
prompted to such thoughtful attempts to do everything
in their power to get well&mdash;even though they
err with the best intentions at heart. Let them
remember, however, that the first effect of hot
water is to increase the blood supply in the tissues
if it be applied for a short time only. In the majority
of cases, the enema does not require more
than from five to ten minutes; hence, only harm
can result if really hot water be used. Now and
then a person will become possessed with the notion
that a hot enema should be followed by a cold
one, to bring “tone” to the lower bowels. But
in all these misdirected efforts matters are made
doubly worse.</p>

<p>Cold water will allay fever and inflammation, but
when its use is once begun it should be continued
without intermission until a cure is effected. For
this reason it is <i>not</i> suitable where chronic inflammation
exists&mdash;especially on the mucous membrane
of the bowels. It is, however, excellent for acute
inflammation of the external parts of the body,
such as the hands, arms, legs, etc., where it can be<span class="pagenum" title="157"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157"></a></span>
continued without interruption for one, two, or
three days if necessary.</p>

<p>In beginning the treatment for con­sti­pa­tion,
there are a few cases in which the patient has to
fuss for an hour or more with the enema before he
can obtain any sort of a proper fecal evacuation;
or there may be inability to expel the water from
the bowels when once injected. This stoppage is
most likely to occur at the recto-sigmoid juncture
(O’Beirne’s sphincter). A strictured condition of
the bowels causes retention of feces and gases
and why not water as well? In such cases time
would be saved, perhaps, by combining the procedure
for an enema with that of a recurrent douche,
which involves a continuous application of water at
a temperature of from one hundred and twenty to
one hundred and thirty-five degrees for an hour or
more. Figure&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_18">21</a> illustrates a successful device for
applying medicated water at a high temperature to
the anus, rectum, and colon. This apparatus can
be used while sitting on a water-closet seat and
the treatment can be completed without changing
position or removing the instrument.</p>

<p>The instrument is attached to the reservoir
(Figure&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_18">18</a>) by a soft-rubber tube. In the cone-shaped
piece of hard rubber (Figure 27) is a hard-rubber
stop-cock or valve (Figure 29), and by turning
the handle sidewise the valve is opened to let
the water escape from the bowels into the toilet
basin. When sufficient water, at from one hundred
and twenty to one hundred and thirty-five degrees<span class="pagenum" title="158"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a></span>
temperature, has entered the bowels, allow it to
remain for ten minutes, then permit it to escape by
opening the valve; then close it and allow more
hot water to flow in and remain for five or ten minutes
and again allow it to escape through the rectal
point, repeating the inflow and outflow every five
or ten minutes for an hour or more without removing
the anal point from the rectum during the
whole time of treatment. After a few trials it will
be found that the hot-water treatment can be
accomplished without withdrawing the point.</p>

<p>Rectal Points for recurrent douche are of two
sizes (Nos. 25 and 26). The larger one (No. 25)
requires a plug to be introduced through the cone-shaped
external anal support and rectal point, to
make its introduction into the rectum easy, after
which the plug is withdrawn and the hot-water
treatment begun. The bore of the rectal points
cannot become clogged by the presence of feces,
mucus or membranous shreds or casts, which are
usually brought away by the hot-water treatment.
At no time during the treatment can the point
become stopped up, the size being sufficient to
insure a proper inflow and outflow. And the
instrument can be easily cleaned.</p>

<p>Near the attachment of the soft-rubber tube is a
glass reservoir (Figure 24), for the use of oils with
the enema or the hot-water treatment; it is detachable.
A valve regulates the outflow of oil from the
pressure of water in the reservoir, as it passes into
the bowels. We are enabled thus to treat by double<span class="pagenum" title="159"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a></span>
medication as it were, a chronic disease of the intestines
and its symptoms&mdash;that is, intestines that
have been long neglected or maltreated through
lack of proper diagnosis, or by all sorts of chemical
compounds from above, through mouth and
stomach.</p>

<p>The author and inventor naturally enjoys not a
little satisfaction in being able to present to sufferers
as nearly perfect an instrument as can be
devised; one that, in conjunction with other aids,
meets all requirements involved in the proper treatment
of proctitis and colitis. Lavage or irrigation
of the large intestine with water at a temperature
at from one hundred and twenty to one hundred
and forty or one hundred and fifty degrees, not
only accomplishes rapid and wonderful cleaning and
curative results, but overcomes, when properly applied,
contracted, congested, engorged, and inflamed
tissues of the bowels. Therapeutically, it has a
marked effect on the whole system, being beneficial
beyond words to describe; it relaxes nervous and
muscular tension of the body, producing restfulness
and sleep; it stimulates and equalizes the circulation,
promotes perspiration, absorption, and
active elimination of all deleterious substances from
all the organs of the body. Medicinally, it is really
a combined internal Russian and Turkish bath, removing
abdominal corpulency and gaseous obesity,
resulting from chronic auto-intoxication. The external
Russian and Turkish baths afford a satisfaction
skin deep to the bather, but the combined internal<span class="pagenum" title="160"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a></span>
Russian and Turkish bath is most agreeably relaxing
and restful to mind and body, bringing peace, since
all the organs of the system are performing their
functions. Some of my patients resort to internal
hot-water lavage for all aches and ills that mar their
happiness. After an external bath the bather may
desire an application of oil, alcohol, or cocoanut
butter rubbed on the skin, and in the same way
the bather’s internal mucous membrane is not
neglected; for, with the author’s appliance, medicated
and perfumed oils, extracts, and powders for
remedial purposes are carried to every part of the
intestines that the water reaches, thus exerting a
cleansing, healing, and soothing effect where most
needed.</p>

<p>A few sufferers will object to the time required
for an enema twice a day, although they find time
to eat three, or even four times a day, without any
objection whatever; there is plenty of time for filling
up the digestive apparatus, but no time for its
normal elimination. And these miserable, go-lucky,
haphazard people are always sick and unfortunate.
The internal Russian and Turkish bath is demanded
only by those who truly desire to be free from their
bowel troubles, and from the numerous symptoms
resulting from mucus absorption, con­sti­pa­tion, and
auto-intoxication.</p>

<p>A sufferer’s efforts to be well depend largely on
how much he or she estimates the worth or value
of mind and body. A noble purpose in life is priceless;
are not one’s spirit and body worth the time<span class="pagenum" title="161"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a></span>
required for two enemata each day and an hour for
the internal bath, if needed? I think so, and you
should likewise.</p>

<p>The author trusts the reader will not infer that
all sufferers from piles, anal fissure, pruritus ani and
vulvæ, mucus channels and reservoirs, abscess, fistula,
and all similar troubles, require the enema and
recurrent douche appliance; the character of the
disease and its symptoms must determine the requirement
of the treatment. Many of my patients
receive office treatment only, omitting home attentions,
although this is not always advisable. The
reader might conclude that the recurrent douche
treatment was simply for the cure of a chronic inflammatory
invasion of the bowels and fecal auto-intoxication,
and not be aware of another great
source of auto-intoxication&mdash;that is, from the absorption
of large quantities of serous, fibrinous, or
albuminous exudation from a large area of tissues
invaded by the very insidious inflammatory process,
a condition which, in time, may reach the pus-forming
stage. Thus we have three very grave pathological
conditions to meet and remove before the
pus-formation stage is made manifest through the
development of abscesses. I have found five aids&mdash;perhaps
more&mdash;to accomplish a cure in which I
have been exceptionally successful, as my students
and patients will verify; these are: local treatment,
local medication, the proper use of the enema, the
use of the recurrent douche, and the determination
of the sufferer to get well.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br />

<span class="smcap">Hot Water in the Treatment of External
Symptoms.</span></h2>


<p>After proctitis has continued for many years
it will give rise to painful inflammatory and
ulcerative processes at the external anal vent and
in the adjoining tissues. The anal mucous membrane
and the integument about the anus become
brittle, loosened, and detached from the areolar
connective tissue by the retention of inflammatory
serum. The engorged, indurated, and swollen
mucous membrane and integument serve as reservoirs,
especially when the chronic inflammation is
excited to an acute stage, which stage is often accompanied
by a fissure, abscess, or anal ulcer.
Soreness and pain in the parts may then be so
severe that the sufferer is compelled to stay indoors
or in bed. Whatever the symptoms may be&mdash;piles,
fissure, pruritus, abscess, or fistula&mdash;the sufferer
desires to reduce the local fever and the acute
inflammation, as well as to find relief from the pain.
The customary treatment is to use poultices, which
are troublesome and ineffective.</p>

<p>In the following illustration I give a good idea
of a perfect device for relieving quickly the soreness,<span class="pagenum" title="163"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a></span>
pain, acute inflammation, and induration, all
of which are so very prostrating; and, situated as
they are physiologically, they are exceedingly inconvenient
to treat properly by the ordinary methods
in use:</p>

<p>The Sitz-bath pan, though small, is yet of sufficient
depth and diameter for all practical purposes,
and can be placed wherever is most convenient&mdash;on
a low chair or a box. The bather should sit on the
instrument with the limbs on either side of the
funnel through which the hot water enters the pan.
Just below the funnel is an overflow tube, under
which a vessel should be placed to catch the water
as it flows out. While sitting on the pan the
elbows may rest on any convenient support, so as
not to tire the invalid too much during the bath,
which should consume from half an hour to an
hour, or longer if agreeable. Hot water may be
added every few minutes as the bather finds that
the tissues will tolerate it. Depurant powder may
also be added to the water in the Sitz-bath pan.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />

<span class="smcap">The Health of School Children.</span></h2>

<p>“Cleanliness of body was ever esteemed to proceed from a
due reverence to God, to society, and to ourselves.”&mdash;<i>Bacon.</i></p>


<p>The International Congress on School Hygiene
ended its fourth meeting at Buffalo recently to
meet two years hence in Brussels. In the interim
the Board of Education in this city, the Department
of Health, and the New York School Luncheon
Committee will continue their investigations as
vigorously as in the past, and the information thus
gained will be an important contribution to the
next Congress.</p>

<p>Too much attention cannot be given to the
question of hygiene, diet, and excretion to meet the
psycho-physical requirements of the mind and body
in normal health. As a rule, diet is prescribed for
the purpose of relieving the various annoying
and painful symptoms caused by chronic impairment
of the functions of the stomach and bowels,
but when we find the cause of these various symptoms
arising from a disturbed gastro-intestinal tract,
the question of diet will receive less attention.
Why has not the subject of normal intestinal<span class="pagenum" title="166"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a></span>
excretion received as much attention as diet in
health or ill-health? As our knowledge of the
human psycho-chemical laboratory increases, we are
able definitely to locate a diseased organ and
account for the symptoms caused by the pathological
condition of that organ; and when the
diagnosis is properly made these symptoms become
a secondary matter of treatment.</p>

<p>The chief enemy of health among school children
(and older persons as well) is the accumulation
and retention of waste matter and gases in the
intestinal canal, where are generated ptomaine,
toxic, and other poisons which enter into the system,
resulting in self-poisoning or auto-intoxication.</p>

<p>What do we mean by school hygiene? Is it
only the school building, or the external appearance
of the children, their eyes, teeth, mouth, nose,
hands? What about the coated tongue, foul
breath, fouler stomach, and putre­fac­tion of the contents
of their intestines? A human being is only
an extension of his gastro-intestinal apparatus,
hence it is very essential that such apparatus should
be in a hygienic state to ensure his physical and
mental resistance and efficiency being at their
normal strength. There is one symptom that
causes more sickness and suffering from infancy to
old age than all others combined&mdash;that is, con­sti­pa­tion
with its attending putre­fac­tion and foulness of
digestive organs. Only a small percentage of
people escape its baneful effects or the secondary
diseases induced by fecal and mucus auto-intoxication.<span class="pagenum" title="167"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a></span>
Such a common primary symptom must
have, necessarily, a common exciting cause or
origin. Through many years of clinical experience
as a gastro-enterologist and proctologist, we have
found that inflammation of the anus, rectum, and
sigmoid flexure is the frequent or common cause
of con­sti­pa­tion. Observation has demonstrated
that a soiled diaper is the exciting cause of Proctitis
and Sigmoiditis in the beginning. Examination
of one hundred children of the “defective
class” would show most of them suffering from
chronic Proctitis and Sigmoiditis, with some degree
of con­sti­pa­tion and auto-intoxication, and even
of those classed as “healthy school children” a
large percentage would show the same conditions.
The continuous invasion of the neighboring tissues
by the disease, the increasing auto-intoxication
and con­sti­pa­tion, the on-coming malnutrition, and
anemia, the gradual emaciation, are all the while
lessening the vitality and power of bodily resistance
of their victims. The early inception of the malady
and its insidious progress, with the symptoms and
diseases resulting, easily deceives the victim as well
as the parents and medical advisers, until the long-pent-up
virulence breaks forth, showing itself in
every part of the tabernacle of the spirit of man,
when the removal of the primary cause does little
or no good.</p>

<p>The Department of Health, in examining the
sanitary or hygienic condition of a school building,
would not devote all its attention to the top story<span class="pagenum" title="168"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a></span>
to overcome unhygienic conditions; it would probably
direct its attention to the trap and vent of the
sewer of the building to see that there was no
retention and filling up of the pipe to befoul the
atmosphere of the structure. Why then so much
attention to the head or top story of the human
temple, and so little to the trap and vent of its
sewer? Are modesty and ignorance to defeat the
progress of hygienic measures dealing with the
stomach and bowels of our school children? How
long will those abdominal incubators of poisonous
microbes and gases be allowed to infect not only
a school building but all its occupants as well?</p>

<p>The absorption into the system of serous, fibrinous
or albuminous mucus exudations from the
invasion of chronic inflammation through all the
layers of the tissues of the anus (Figure&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_1">1</a>), rectum,
and sigmoid flexure, as well as through the adjoining
fatty tissue in the pelvic space around the
organs (Figure&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_5">5</a>), under the skin and between the
muscles of the buttocks, goes on continuously, creating
an extensive inflammable area and source of
exudation of broken-down tissues. (See Chapter
III.) It is a grave pathological condition and the
source of mucus auto-intoxication, and its symptoms
ought to be differentiated from those of fecal
auto-intoxication. This mucus exudate has an
intensely irritating effect on the nervous system,
especially when an acute intestinal mucus storm
has developed, torturing its victims and unfitting
them mentally to attend to the ordinary duties of<span class="pagenum" title="169"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a></span>
the day. Very often this is accompanied by more
or less pain or muscular soreness. These annoying
symptoms occur very early in the history of
Proctitis and Sigmoiditis, and clinical experience
has demonstrated to me and to my students the
necessity for infants and children being examined
in order to determine whether inflammation exists in
the anus and rectum, and thus early cut short the
progress of the disease and its numerous and familiar
symptoms, which I may here enumerate, to
wit: indigestion, flatulency, coated tongue, foul
breath, bad taste in the mouth, capricious appetite,
nausea, intestinal colic, cramps and pains, diarrhea,
headache or band of pain encircling the head with
sense of constriction, neuralgia, pain about the
heart, cold hands and feet, malnutrition, anemia,
emaciation, dry skin, seborrhea sicca, carbonic acid
toxemia, sallow complexion, liver spots, jaundice,
acute bilious attacks, drowsy states, mental torpor,
bad temper, night terrors, irritability, melancholia,
vertigo, dizziness, loss of memory, insomnia, drawn
face, tired feeling, unrestful sleep, easily fatigued,
subject to colds, catarrhal affections of the ears,
eyes, nose, throat, etc., decay of teeth, dry cough,
loss of hair, impaired vision, sterility, impotency,
mucus and membranous cords and casts from the
bowels, sediment in the urine, irritability of the
bladder, premature age, reduced physical and mental
efficiency, inability to concentrate the mind,
morbidity, suicidal notions with a view to ending
mental and physical suffering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="170"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a></span></p>

<p>I am pleased to inform such sufferers that their
ills can be properly diagnosed and treated; and the
earlier in life they seek treatment, the sooner they
will escape the accumulative ills that make existence
so painful to endure.</p>

<p>We have mentioned Proctitis and Sigmoiditis as
the primary cause of intestinal stasis in the majority
of cases; later, other sections of the intestinal
canal may be invaded by inflammatory process,
causing a more serious intestinal stasis, not infrequently
bringing about dislocation of the stomach,
intestines, and other abdominal organs. We have
enumerated the symptoms and maladies that are
now, in the light of latest medical science, traceable
directly or indirectly, to this primary cause; in short,
it may be said that, with the exception of a few
diseases caused by toxic agents, most of the illnesses
that cause so much invalidism, cutting short
our lives, can be traced to mucus and fecal auto-intoxication.</p>

<p>The purpose of this book and others I have
published is to educate my fellow beings as to how
to prevent or avoid the many diseases and symptoms
that afflict them from the cradle to the grave;
already I feel that I have accomplished something
in helping humanity, and I trust others will do their
part to lessen the ills that flesh is heir to through
neglect and ignorance.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI<span class="nowrap">.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span><br />

<span class="smcap">Internal Hemorrhoids or Piles versus Rectal
Mucous Sac, Recto-Anal Mucous Sac.</span></h2>


<p>Before the history of medicine and surgery
began, man suffered at his hinder parts as well
as at other parts of his organism. Bodily ills are
as old as the human race, and the flowing of blood
from the “terhinder” was a signal of distress or
of physical anarchy, of which the references to
“emeroids” in the Bible and in other ancient writings
bear witness. The “emeroid” doctors of
Egypt, in the time of Moses, unquestionably regarded
the distress caused by the “emeroids” as a
disease. And it came to pass that every subsequent
Moses that has written on the subject of hemorrhoids
up to the present time has regarded piles as
a disease. And they likewise, all of them without
exception, believe the “disease” to be hereditary,
as is certainly their information on the subject.
This mental obsequiousness of the proctologists of
our day is indeed quite a long-drawn-out compliment
to the pile doctors of Egypt, since our proctologists
still continue to diagnose piles as a disease and “to
smite the smitten of emeroids.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="172"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a></span></p>

<p>I have always respected the idea of ancestral
worship and of reverence for the dead past, but at
the same time I have felt that one should not be
wholly oblivious to their egregious mistakes.</p>

<p>If Moses, Samuel, Herodotus, Hippocrates, Galen,
and other illustrious men had said that “emeroids”
is a symptom of a disease, what a blessing they
would have conferred upon suffering humanity.
The simple use of that one word would have been
illuminating, and would have set the tide of attention
for the proper diagnosis and treatment in the
right direction. Possibly some one more bold than
the servile brotherhood did see and say that it was
a mere symptom, but, if so, his temerity was treated
by “the wise ones” of that day as similar innovations
are treated to-day, with a “Tut, tut, tut; pugh, pugh,
pugh. We know better, and we refer you to the
following chapters in Holy Writ and to the classical
work of the great Medi Cusus on ‘Pilus Diseasicus.’
And besides, have you no respect for the superior
clinical advantages we enjoy?”</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the bad odor in which I shall be
held, I will nerve myself to claim that, when the
ancients considered and called piles or hemorrhoids
a disease, they made a very grave and palpable
mistake, and that, having made this mistake, it was
inevitable that numerous errors should follow logically
in its train when they attempted to account for
the etiology, character, and means of cure of this
“disease.”</p>

<p>Pruritus ani is also called a disease, and a similar<span class="pagenum" title="173"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a></span>
bedlam of reasons is offered as causes and means
of cure, all of which accounts for the many, many
pages of a book filled to overflowing by a “classical”
author, with compilations of the redeeming gospel
truths on this subject from prehistoric times till the
present day, including his own commentary, guesses,
interpretations, and surmises. Ignorant as he is of
the nature of this symptom, the conjectures of his
perfervid imagination are “to laugh.” The errors
of one or more authors, endorsed by the mistakes
of others, seemingly make a truth to minds that
are vassals to authority, which accounts for much
of the useless medical literature of to-day and for
the mistakes of those that are misguided by it.</p>

<p>Considering the pathological condition, it would
be better if we were to give a more definitive characterization
to it than “piles” or “hemorrhoids.”
In accordance with the distinctive exhibit contemplated,
we should describe it as a rectal mucous
sac, an ano-rectal mucous sac, or an ano-muco-cutaneous
sac. These are more distinctive and suitable
designations for these symptoms of chronic
proctitis, inasmuch, by such designations, we call
attention to the fact that they are simply constricted
<span class="nowrap">mucus<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span> channels and sacs, with engorged arteries
and veins, formed by the serous exudation that accompanies
inflammation.</p>

<p>If a recto-anal mucus channel, under one or more<span class="pagenum" title="174"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a></span>
layers of the mucous membrane, becomes constricted
or obstructed (they usually do), its epithelial wall
will become sacculated, and then we have a rectal
mucous sac, or an ano-rectal mucous sac, or an ano-muco-cutaneous
sac, all of which may be present in
the same case. The inflammatory exudation called
serum distends and destroys fatty tissue, which
makes space for its lodgment under the tissue that
imprisons it, and at the same time there occurs
more or less proliferation of the cells of the tissue
involved in the severe inflammation. The internal
sphincter muscle, by its contraction, aids in the
undue retention of the mucus and blood above it,
hence the so-called pile-bearing region&mdash;that is, the
sacculated mucosa region. The serous exudation
meets with obstruction along the anal canal and the
mucosa is sacculated. When the integument around
the anus offers obstruction to the flow of serum and
blood, we find that muco-cutaneous sacs are formed
around the anus. If the exudation occurs in the
areolar space under the ano-rectal mucosa, it
readily passes down into the areolar space under
the integument around the anus, and thence to
parts deep, devious, and far away, as described in
Chapter III.</p>

<p>Channels, reservoirs, sacs, that would hold from
one to eight or more ounces of fluid, no longer
excite my wonder and amazement at the extensive
and serious pathological condition of which they
are exhibits, a pathological condition that occasions
symptoms often diagnosed as sciatica, rheumatism,<span class="pagenum" title="175"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a></span>
myalgia, caries of the coccyx, coxitis, prostatitis,
pruritus ani, scroti, and vulvæ, auto-intoxication,
anemia, invalidism, etc.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as we have learned the cause of sacculated
mucosa at the lower end of the rectum and
over the anal canal and of the integument around
it, we had better in future omit the following designations
and distinctions, which are merely a ridiculous
display of sciolism. Surely we can do without
them, and ought to do so for the sake of
truth and simplicity. With a sigh of relief let us
in future ignore: Safety-valve piles, organized
piles, itching piles, blind piles, bleeding piles,
moon piles, cutaneous piles, thrombotic piles, external
and internal pile tumors, venous piles,
ulcerated piles, capillary piles, mixed hemorrhoids,
arterial hemorrhoids, white hemorrhoids, acute
hemorrhoids, chestnut hemorrhoids, chronic hemorrhoids,
inflammatory hemorrhoids, hypertrophic
hemorrhoids, atrophic hemorrhoids, Egyptian piles,
Philistine itching hemorrhoids, etc.</p>

<p>Quite naturally such a variety of “diseases”
called forth many sorts of surgical operations for
their removal, of which the following are the ones
most in vogue: Clamp and cautery, ligature, crushing
electrolysis, excision, submucous ligation, the
Whitehead operation, the Earle operation, the
American operation, etc.</p>

<p>Forget them all, forget all of the senseless terms
that are employed to describe a supposed variety
of “disease” and all of the barbarous procedures<span class="pagenum" title="176"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a></span>
for their banishment, and the banishment, alas!
too frequently, of the wretched sufferer likewise.</p>

<p>Study carefully the varieties of chronic inflammation
and the character and extent of the exudation
in each case. By so doing you will ascertain
the nature of the many varied symptoms of proctitis,
of which the following are the most common:
Sacculated mucosa and integument, submucous and
sub­tegu­men­tary channels, reservoirs, pockets, fistula,
pruritus ani, fissure- or ulcer-in-ano, con­sti­pa­tion,
diarrhea, etc.</p>

<p>Proctitis may present a chronic, a subacute, or an
acute stage, with an atrophic or hypertrophic condition,
or a less marked structural change in the
tissue. If proctitis were treated early in its inception,
none of the above-mentioned symptoms would
have occasion to develop. When mankind becomes
properly enlightened on the subject of proctitis, due
attention will be given to it long before so many
annoying symptoms occur.</p>

<p>Ano-rectal mucous sacs, formed by the serous
exudation into the connective tissue and stasis of
the blood, are the slightest symptoms of proctitis,
and by far the most easily removed.</p>

<p>Since we have found out what are the symptoms
and what is the disease, it naturally follows that in
treating a sacculated mucosa we should be governed
by the character of the proctitis, whether it be in a
chronic, subacute, or acute stage. If the inflammation
be acute, no matter whether or not there is a
general prolapse of the sacculated tissue, it may be<span class="pagenum" title="177"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a></span>
well to delay the treatment for removal of one or
more mucous sacs until we have in a degree overcome
the acute inflammation by the use of a shallow
sitz bath, Fig.&nbsp;<a href="#Fig_23">23</a>, and by the use of a soothing
ointment and liquid remedy, to meet the depurant
requirements of the case.</p>

<p>The removal of the chronic inflammation, in whatever
state it may be found, should be a paramount
feature of the treatment from the time a case comes
under one’s care. The cure of the disease ought to
be of more importance than the removal of a symptom
or symptoms. Should there be bleeding from a
mucous sac, or should there be prolapse of it, or both,
immediate treatment will give relief at once, and the
sufferer will think you have performed a miracle, especially
if the annoyance has existed for many years.</p>

<p>After the immediately annoying mucous sacs are
removed by the hypodermic method, a physician
can doubly guard his reputation in the painless
treatment of mucous sacs by delaying further treatment
of those remaining sacs, which, if treated,
might occasion special annoyance, till such a time as
the general inflammatory condition is much improved;
but in the interim he may treat the mucous
sacs that are located above the sphincter muscles,
and the granular and ulcerated regions.</p>

<p>For the almost universal success in the painless
removal of mucous sacs, the operator should be in
possession of all of his normal wits and senses, so
that his judgment will be at its best when the following
points present themselves:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="178"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a></span></p>

<p>What to treat.</p>

<p>When to treat it.</p>

<p>Where to treat it.</p>

<p>How much to treat of it.</p>

<p>The quantity of remedy to be injected&mdash;all of
which require discretion and good technique.</p>

<p>By the hypodermic method of treating mucous
sacs some escharotic is employed with the object
of causing the absorption of the sacculated mucosa.
The object to be accomplished ought to determine
the proper strength of any escharotic used. Whatever
will absorb the mucous membrane involved in
the sac in the slowest and mildest manner is the
best remedy or the best way to employ any of the
tissue absorbers you might select. And another
fact: the lower the per cent. employed the larger
the quantity that may be used at a time, and this is
desirable if the area of a sac be large and you wish
to absorb the greater portion of it. A skillful
operator will make sure to have the escharotic used
cover just the amount of the mucous sac desired,
and no more. Physicians that are not aware of the
channeled and sacculated character of the mucosa
in the case of “piles” or “hemorrhoids” are liable
to introduce the escharotic into the base or the
center of the mucous sac with the hypodermic
needle; and in such an event the remedy often
enters a cavity or a channel, or both, and naturally
it finds its way along the channel to the integument
at the anus, whence, as a consequence, a deep, ugly
fissure-in-ano is in a short time to be reckoned with<span class="pagenum" title="179"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a></span>
by the patient and the physician, because of the
destruction of the epithelial wall of the channel.
The patient thereupon is far from being in a
good humor, and the physician wonders how the
thing happened, and he feels like quitting practice
altogether, and doubtless many have done so; and
certainly every one should do so if such an error
were to occur a second time.</p>

<p>The object we wish to accomplish is to absorb
the wall of the sacculated mucosa. Therefore the
remedy should be injected at the apex of the sac,
in the epithelial layer, or slightly deeper, if the
occasion demands it. The area of the sac and the
thickness of its walls must be taken into con­sid­er­ation,
and will suggest the amount of the escharotic
to be used.</p>

<p>A proper speculum is very essential to the successful
treatment of sacculated mucosa, and I know
of none equal to that devised some thirty years
ago by Dr. A.&nbsp;W. Brinkerhoff. The speculum is
easy to introduce, and by drawing a slide the tissue
is properly exposed or shut out to a nicety, exhibiting
just the amount you wish to treat. In
some cases there is a rather lengthy sacculated mucosa
on the side, or on the anterior wall of the anorectal
tube, and it is advisable to treat only the
upper third or half, and at a subsequent visit or
visits to treat the remainder, thus avoiding annoyance
to the patient.</p>

<p>The paramount concern should be to avoid
causing pain both during the treatment of a sacculated<span class="pagenum" title="180"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180"></a></span>
mucosa or its possible occurrence a few
hours or days later. I have often remarked that
when pain or soreness follows the treatment of a
mucous sac the fault is in the application of the
remedy, and not in the remedy itself. Now and
then there may be conditions in which you will
expect pain or soreness to follow the treatment, and
you will prepare your patient with the necessary
appliances and remedies to overcome it promptly.
Where there are no possible means for avoiding
the pain consequent upon a treatment, leave
nothing undone to make it as slight as possible.
All mucous sacs ought to be treated without any
after-annoyance to the patient, and they can be if
we only wait for the proper time to treat them.</p>

<p>I have not thus far considered the muco-cutaneous
sacs around the anus, which are neither useful
nor ornamental, and which often indicate the volcanic
action of inflammation and the amount of
mucous lava thrown out around the vent.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.<br />

<span class="smcap">External and Thrombotic Piles versus Muco-Cutaneous
Sacs and Thrombus.</span></h2>


<p>The vent of a crater indicates the convulsive
and destructive changes that have taken place
within; and, very often, the vent of the gastro-enteric
sewer gives like evidence of long, great, and
severe destructive changes. The fire of inflammation
has burned fiercely for many, many years,
and serous lava has, from time to time, poured
forth, leaving a searing, inflammatory path. As it
was forced from the recto-anal crater, the acrid,
burning mucus, that had been imprisoned, made
subcutaneous streams, cavities, channels, sacs,
etc. Its course is marked around the anus by
peaks, crags, muco-skinny tabs, small and large
bulging muco-cutaneous sacs, dilated anal veins in
which clots of blood often form; light gray, brittle,
shiny skin with small and large red and sore oases,
thickly studded over the itching area, which the
sufferer has scratched in the vain hope of appeasing
the torture of pruritus ani, scroti, vulvæ; while
cold drops of perspiration stand over his or her
face and body, serving to indicate the physical and
mental anguish inexpressible in words.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="182"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a></span></p>

<p>Muco-serous exudations under one or more
layers of the recto-anal mucous membrane finds its
way down to the integument around the anus, and
being of a very irritating character, greatly increases
the inflammatory process in the tissues it
comes in contact with. Thus the increased inflammation
and blood stasis and the augmented
serum unite in hurrying the development of skinny
tabs and the more or less capacious muco-cutaneous
rugæ and sacs.</p>

<p>When the serous exudation takes place entirely
under the recto-anal mucous membrane, there may
be formed a large muco-cutaneous anal sac, especially
on the right or left side of the anus, or the
serum may pass under the integument about the
anus with little or no anatomical change in the appearance
of the skin at or about the anus. In the
latter case, an experienced eye can detect sufficient
evidence to diagnose the destructive changes
wrought by the presence of serum in the connective
tissue under the skin and ano-rectal mucous
membrane.</p>

<p>The skin is not, as it should be, held fast by the
connective tissue, but lies loose over the cavity;
and a similar pathological condition exists under
the mucous membrane of the anus, rectum, and
sigmoid flexure, which circum­stance might lead one,
in some instances, to conclude that there was almost
an entire separation of the mucous membrane
from the areolar tissue, by the ridges, folds, large,
pouched, prolapsed, sacculated regions of mucous<span class="pagenum" title="183"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a></span>
membrane that has the appearance of having been
simply carelessly laid over the muscular structure
of the organs. When we observe such destructive
changes by the invasion of serous exudation under
the mucous membrane, we have every reason to
expect peri­proc­titis and peri­sig­moid­itis, with the
possibility of the formation of pus occurring with
the usual consequences. So remarkable and serious
are the excursions of the mucous currents into
healthy neighboring tissue that we find a symptom
of a disease vastly more annoying and serious than
the disease itself. Is it any wonder we find stenosis
(narrowing of the passage) of eight, ten, or more
inches of the lower portion of the large intestine,
which is usually diagnosed atony of the bowels?
Surely, you must by this time appreciate the reason
I made so strong an appeal for the twice daily use
of the enema as a means of relief. You need the
combination of many aids over a long period of
time to effect a cure of proctitis, etc., and its numerous
symptoms. Proctitis and colitis is a serious
affliction, and should have your undivided attention
with the hearty co-operation of the patient in effecting
a cure. How foolish is the practice of removing
one or two annoying symptoms (piles and
fistula) and leaving the sufferer untreated, the disease
itself and the other symptoms not so apparent
at the time of the operation, and then dismiss the
case as cured! Shame on such practice, in which
ignorance and cupidity dominate! Humanity cries
for a correct diagnosis and a humane treatment!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="184"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a></span></p>

<p>The profuse serous exudation resulting from
proctitis and sigmoiditis makes its way from the
diseased area into the neighboring regions like lava
from an active volcano, carrying with it an intense
burning inflammation, destroying normal fatty tissue
as it advances, owing to its extremely acrid
character. Is it any wonder that we find dilated
veins and arteries in the lower rectal and ano-rectal
canal and around the anus where stasis of the blood
has existed for a great many years? The real
wonder is that thrombus in the veins around the
anus does not occur more frequently than it does.
What is the necessity of calling such a pathological
change in the caliber of a vein and the weakening of
its walls “thrombotic pile”? Thrombus is a clot of
blood in a vein, and there is no use in adding the word
“pile.” The aggravated character of the inflammation
accounts for the hypertrophied and the cicatricial
tissue so often found around the anal vent of
proctitis cases. The Biblical suggestion that sacculated
mucosa, commonly termed piles or hemorrhoids,
is a disease, accounts for the numerous
names used to designate the particular variety of
the disease&mdash;whether it be an internal or an external
pile tumor. It is very wrong to so mislead
“scientific” medical men. Had they only known
that the numerous sacs, bags, prolapsed pouches,
longitudinal and transverse folds of the ano-rectal
mucous membrane, and the ragged, jagged, prolapsed,
pouched muco-cutaneous tissue around the
anus, as well as the fissure-in-ano, pruritus ani, fistula,<span class="pagenum" title="185"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a></span>
are only symptoms of a disease, all of the
many abnormal changes and the other symptoms
could have been prevented many generations ago
by simply treating their exciting cause. But it is
never too late to learn things that will benefit
mankind.</p>

<p>Don’t for a moment think that all of the
structural changes on the mucous membrane and
about the anus mentioned above indicate an affliction
only skin deep, or even the depth of the
mucous membrane. They are far worse than that.
You will find all the muscular structure of the anal
organ and that of the rectum sigmoid flexure
severely invaded by the inflammatory process and
its fibrinous exudation, and also the external tissues
that surround and support the organs.</p>

<p>We have circular and longitudinal muscular tissue
entering into the structure of the anus and rectum.
The sphincter muscles are two large and strong
muscles that close the anal orifice and guard its
vent very effectually if they are not destroyed by a
surgeon’s knife.</p>

<p>The acrid burning serum coming in contact with
the muscular tissue excites an aggravated inflammation
in its structure as elsewhere. The constant
irritation results in more or less permanent contraction
of the sphincter muscles in which fibrinous
exudation takes place, binding the contracted muscular
fibers together. In time their expansibility is
lost in many cases, and in other cases partially so,
necessitating divulsion of the sphincters in order to<span class="pagenum" title="186"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a></span>
break up the adhesions and establish a somewhat
normal circulation of the blood in the diseased
parts, also in order to relieve the irritation to the
nerves distributed to the organs and their marked
reflex excitement. In some cases an expansion of
the sphincters for one and a half inches or two
inches is quite sufficient; other cases may require
a little more thorough divulsion; but never weaken
or paralyze the sphincters, as your patient needs
their normal use, and you need the reputation of
never causing incontinence of feces. Guard the
usefulness of the sphincters as you would a
valuable treasure.</p>

<p>As a rule, I treat all of the ano-rectal sacculated
mucosa in cases where divulsion is required before
performing the dilatation to break up the adhesions,
and very frequently the muco-cutaneous sacs and
distended veins as well. It may be well to delay
the divulsion&mdash;with which there is usually no hurry&mdash;until
you determine how many U-shaped (or hairpin
shaped) mucus channels and recto-anal mucus
fistulas there may be present that have passed down
under the recto-anal mucous membrane, down to the
integument about the anus, and then pressed immediately
upward again along the outer wall of the
anus and rectum, to the extent of six inches or
more. There may be three, four, six, or more of
them quite prominent as to length and size.</p>

<p>For the treatment of the recto-anal sacculated
mucosa the injection method is par excellent. For
the removal of the muco-cutaneous sac a double<span class="pagenum" title="187"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a></span>
V-shaped incision, the proper depth, length, and
width, will remove the surplus or redundant tissue,
after which the edges are brought together with a
catgut suture,&mdash;or omit the suture if you think best,&mdash;followed
by the home attention as prescribed for
fissure-in-ano in a previous chapter. At the time
of removing the sacculated tissue attention may also
be given to the mucus channel; or you may, if you
wish, leave it so that at some future treatment you
can give it the desired attention. A one or two
per cent. solution of alypin, cocain, or beta eucain
will produce the necessary local anesthesia for a
painless operation. I remove only one muco-cutaneous
sac at a treatment, which permits the
patient to go about as usual without much inconvenience.</p>

<p>If you have removed all of the ano-rectal sacculated
mucosa in a case, and have omitted to remove
the one or more ano-muco-cutaneous sacs or dilated
veins that are so often present around the anus,
and have also neglected to cure the chronic proctitis,
then the sacculated mucosa may, by some
hook or crook, become excited again into an acute
inflammatory condition, the sphincter muscles may
grip tighter than usual, and lo, thrombus has taken
place in a vein, and the wrinkled, shriveled, skinny
tab or sac looks like a miniature balloon, and your
dismissed patient is in a troubled state of mind to
have everything come back on him so soon!</p>

<p>The cure was all right so far as it went, but
there was the disease and some of the old external<span class="pagenum" title="188"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a></span>
symptoms to tell the tale of an incompleted treatment.</p>

<p>Those muco-cutaneous sacs at the enteric crater’s
mouth are just so many thermometers at its vent
to tell the temperature occasioned by the fire of inflammation
within, and they will damage your
reputation as a proctologist if they be not removed.
By all means get rid of these symptoms and indicators
of trouble within; and if there should by
chance be a little of the old proctitis remaining
that wants to assert itself by making trouble,
in becoming acute, it will be surprisingly handicapped
in its efforts, and the chances are all in your
favor; and you will, moreover, from time to time,
hear what So-and-So said about the very successful
treatment of his or her case.</p>

<p>Sacculated mucosa, muco-cutaneous sacs, submucous
channels, etc., having their source in the
rectum and anus, are all of a similar origin, the
result of serous exudation. These symptoms of
proctitis vary in development and number according
to the nature and progress of the disease. In those
cases that are quite exempt from sacculated mucosa
(piles) you may expect to find submucous channels
largely developed, and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<p>Too much stress cannot be placed upon the serious
results of auto-intoxication by the absorption
of mucus from channels and cavities that will
hold from three to eight or more ounces of fluid at
one time. They are no doubt rapidly emptied by
the process of absorption into the system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" title="189"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a></span></p>

<p>I have not referred to the fatalities of the hypodermic
treatment of sacculated mucosa (piles or
hemorrhoids) because of the fact that none have ever
occurred within my knowledge among those using
either this or a similar method of treatment.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />

<span class="smcap">Abscess and Fistula Involving Anus, Rectum,
and Neighboring Regions.</span></h2>


<p>Hippocrates, the father of medicine, Celsus,
Galen, and other writers in the early
times, described fistula as a disease; and, naturally
enough, through the influence of heredity, contagion,
imitation, and auto-suggestion, every author
on the subject to the present day has chimed in
most complaisantly with his “Ditto! ditto! ditto!”
“Me too! me too! me too!” I am sure that the
rank and file of my medical brethren will agree
with me that modern authors are hardly justified
in this servility to the ideas of the fathers of medicine
in this recreance to their duties toward suffering
humanity. Is it that they do not know better,
or that they are naturally servile and thus too lazy
to do their own thinking?</p>

<p>Let me in connection with this point call your
attention to a practice that many of us have been
suspicious of for a long time, a suspicion that has
been confirmed for me by one who speaks from
positive knowledge; otherwise I should not refer
to it here. The practice I am about to describe<span class="pagenum" title="191"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a></span>
will make it plain why we have so many “Ditto
and Me-too” authors on proctology and other
medical subjects.</p>

<p>An eminent surgeon who mentally is as large as
the human race, and has room for all that is good
in medicine and surgery, narrated the following
incident of his career to a learned doctor from
Georgia and myself recently. Snatching occasionally
a few moments from a busy practice, he has
prepared sufficient material to make a book, and
desired some competent person to edit it before
publication. So he consulted an ethical co-worker
concerning such a person. In a few days a gentleman
called at the doctor’s house to inquire about
the contemplated publication. The caller asked
the title and size of the book, and when told volunteered
the startling information that he could have
the work ready in a few weeks’ time, but that in
the meantime he would like to hear the doctor
lecture once or twice that he might catch a few
peculiar expressions to use in the work, so that the
doctor’s friends, when reading the book, would say,
“That sounds just like the doctor; that is his style
of talking.” The would-be scribe never asked for
the author’s manuscript, so accustomed was he to
rely upon the medical literature to be found in the
libraries of the city for all the information needed.
It is hardly necessary to add that the professional
bookmaker was summarily dismissed. The doctor’s
manuscript is still unpublished.</p>

<p>There is a third reason for so many “Ditto and<span class="pagenum" title="192"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192"></a></span>
Me-too” authors. Publishers of medical books
naturally desire to extend their business, and in
order to do this they must issue new works of medicine
in the same way that lay publishing houses
compete for new works of fiction. Now, doctors
usually obtain professorships in some institution by
paying five thousand dollars or more for them, and
in due time a publisher of medical books will tempt
the professor to become an author. They place
before him their great facilities for getting up a
book, arguing that consequently but little or no
labor on the professor’s part is required. They
point out to him the fame and honor the publication
will bring him, and at the same time estimate
how much money they will make out of it. In due
time a “Ditto and Me-too” medical brief, résumé,
or treatise, is published covering the whole history
of the subject, from Biblical mention of it to the
present day. All of us have observed what a great
amount of stuffing or padding it takes to make a
book that is to sell for five or seven dollars. It
occurs to me that it might be wise to get up a conference
of enlightened physicians to take some
practical steps or to devise some laws that will
prevent such impositions on the too confiding
medical brethren by unscrupulous publishers that
rob them of their hard-earned income through delusive
advertising. Still, before any action is taken
that would result in effectively closing the door to
this practice, it may be as well that the eyes of
more of us should be opened that we may not continue<span class="pagenum" title="193"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a></span>
to be duped and stung again and again by
“Ditto and Me-too” scrapbooks with hundreds
of pictures. When seeking for new and better
information to help suffering humanity, let us be
served for a little while longer with “rehashed rot.”</p>

<p>Pardon this digression. We will now consider,
at first hand, the subject of fistula.</p>

<p>As a rule, pus in a fistula is a secondary symptom
of chronic proctitis, except those fistulæ that
occur from traumatic injury to the region of the
rectum, anus, and buttocks. Early in my practice I
entertained the idea that the formation of pus occurred
at the point of dissolution of the tissue, and
that, as the volume of pus increased it made its way
in the direction of least resistance through it, if the
abscess had not been opened by an incision. The
idea was well founded when it was applied to the
traumatic origin of an abscess and fistula, but not
when their origin was traced to chronic proctitis.</p>

<p>It may seem incredible to all who read this that
a mucus channel or a fistula can be formed for
ten, twenty, forty, or more years before the formation
of pus takes place in it; and that the pus exerts
no part in producing the diameter or length of the
fistula, which may have a capacity of six, eight, or
more ounces of fluid. As soon as the chronic inflammatory
process has penetrated one or more
layers of the mucous membrane, mucus channel or
fistula-formation must take place. If the sphincter
muscles be rather weak or lax I would not expect
sacculation of the rectal mucosa to occur to any<span class="pagenum" title="194"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a></span>
extent. In these cases, however, the muco-cutaneous
channels are usually found quite large and numerous.
Of course the extent of the ano-rectal symptoms in
each case depend upon how severe the chronic inflammatory
process has been, and is, at the lower
portion of the enteric canal. Often you will find
that the seat of the most active chronic inflammation
is in the middle and upper portion of the
rectum, involving also the sigmoid colon. In these
cases the ano-rectal symptoms are not numerous, if
there be any at all, on the mucous membrane, but
under it you may expect mucus channels that
serve as outlets for the inflammatory product.</p>

<p>In every case of chronic proctitis and sigmoiditis
submucous and sub­tegu­men­tary fistulæ can be
found, and my experience in tracing them warrants
me in stating that peri­proc­titis and peri­sig­moid­itis
is present also; the latter pathological
condition being due to the invasion of submucous
and sub­tegu­men­tary channels or fistulæ around
the outside of the structure of the anus and rectum,
extending far up into the neighboring tissues of
the pelvic space that support the rectum and
sigmoid flexure.</p>

<p>The formation of pus in a submucous or sub­tegu­men­tary
channel that has existed for many
years does not make it a disease; it is only
another incidental phase added to an already existing
symptom of chronic proctitis.</p>

<p>Mucus fistulæ should be diagnosed and treated
early in their formation, or at least before the<span class="pagenum" title="195"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a></span>
tissues involved became so deteriorated as to form
pus in quantity sufficient to occasion the usual
period of suffering, fever, loss of rest and sleep
before the pus is freed from its enclosure. The
formation of pus in a mucous fistula is only incidental
and marks a stage in the distinctive
changes that have been going on for many, many
years in the tissues involved in the inflammatory
exudation.</p>

<p>The numerous small and large submucous and
sub­tegu­men­tary fistulæ found in every case of
chronic proctitis and sigmoiditis was the most
grave and far-reaching of the numerous symptoms,
but for three decades I have fully realized the
baneful effects from mucus irritation, and the self-poisoning
by the absorption of large quantities of
serum and fibrinous septic material from the surface
of the mucous membrane involved, as well as
that from numerous long, cavernous mucus fistulæ:
a fearful double source of auto-intoxication, for
which it is useless to prescribe diet, tonics, and
travel for building up the system and restoring the
health.</p>

<p>Besides the numerous general symptoms, arising
from self-poisoning by fecal and mucus absorption,
we have more or less marked local symptoms in
many cases; and if these be not present, the diagnosis
can be made out from the general debility of
the system and the character of the chronic proctitis
and sigmoiditis.</p>

<p>The local symptoms of mucus fistulæ, peri­proc­titis,<span class="pagenum" title="196"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a></span>
and peri­sig­moid­itis are, each of them, universally
diagnosed as a disease: Such symptoms as pruritus
ani, scroti, vulvæ, lumbago, sciatica, myalgia, rheumatism,
prostatitis, coxitis, disease of the coccyx,
chafing about the anus and along the thigh and
scrotum, difficulty in getting up after sitting for a
while, pain in the back of the neck, lame back, legs
feel tired, and sometimes pain is very annoying,
abnormal color of the skin, painful or sore spots at
times, confinement in bed for many weeks from
severe continuous pain in and about the rectum, etc.</p>

<p>Up to the present time proctologists have paid
little or no attention to proctitis and sigmoiditis,
which is a grave disease, with a far more serious
symptom, that of mucus fistulæ of great length and
diameter, extending in all directions in the pelvic
cavity and tissues of the buttocks, the large area of
tissue found so full of holes, might be likened to a
sponge occupying the same space. They are very
numerous in every case of chronic proctitis and
sigmoiditis.</p>

<p>This will explain why an incidental symptom
like pus in a fistula is commonly called a disease by
the “Ditto and Me-too” authors, and why it is so
frequently met with in practice. At some hospitals
one-half of the cases treated suffer from fistula in
which pus has formed. Why the per cent. is not
much greater I am unable to explain, except to
give credit to the defensive and restorative power
of the human body. If the peri­proc­titis and peri­sig­moid­itis,
brought on by the mucus fistulæ, is<span class="pagenum" title="197"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a></span>
not treated at the same time as the cause, the
treatment will be of no consequence in effecting a
cure of the chronic inflammation of the lower
bowels. Every mucus fistula should be located
and healed at the time that the disease itself is
treated; then the work will be well done. Every
mucus fistula should be diagnosed and treated
before the breaking down of the tissues reaches the
pus-forming stage, and thus obviate all suffering,
annoyance, and possible death. Attention to this
course will ensure your treatment of the disease,
and its symptoms, to be taken in time.</p>

<p>The only hindrance to the successful office treatment
of a fistula in which pus has incidentally
formed is the fear that you can not cure it, or
that you will fail, or that at a hospital it
could be cured quicker, better, and cheaper.
These ideas are born of heredity, timidity,
fear-habit, power of auto-suggestion, and too
much caution on your part. They are all falsehoods
and should not be heeded for a moment.
During thirty years of practice in my specialty I
have sent seven of my fistula patients to a hospital
for treatment, and four of that number I afterwards
very much regretted sending, as I could
have accomplished the cure in a safer and better
way by the usual office method of cure. In fact
every fistula, pus or no pus,&mdash;I do not care how
bad it may be,&mdash;can be cured by office treatment
and at the same time aided by the home attentions
of the patient. There may be periods of a year or<span class="pagenum" title="198"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a></span>
more when your energies are overtaxed with numerous
patients, and you feel like dividing the labor
with some fellow-practitioner, and this in a measure
accounts for those I induced to go, or was
willing to have go, to the hospital.</p>

<p>Unless overwork is the excuse, you need never
send a fistula patient to a hospital for treatment.
I have everything to say in praise of the ambulant
treatment of ano-rectal fistula and the mucus channels,
since my practice thus far has been devoid of
any unfavorable results,&mdash;a fact which should have
much weight in favor of the ambulant office treatment
of all of the many symptoms of chronic
proctitis, sigmoiditis, and colitis.</p>

<p>Mucus fistula is very easily healed in all cases,
and those cases in which pus has incidentally formed
are likewise not difficult to cure. All you need to
do is to instill intelligence in a stupid patient, if
you haven’t an intelligent one, and induce him to
utilize or improvise a few home conveniences for
cleansing the fistula night and morning between
office visits. During the treatment of the fistula
patients will be able to attend to their imperative
duties.</p>

<p>To properly explore a fistula and its branches, if
any, as to whether pyogenesis (pus) has taken place
or not, it is essential to have the external opening
through the skin of sufficient depth and size to
permit of the application of remedies over all its
surface. For a mucus fistula antiseptic remedies
can be applied after a thorough irrigation by hot<span class="pagenum" title="199"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199"></a></span>
water at a temperature of one hundred and twenty
degrees, or more, for half an hour or less time, as
the case may demand. Where pyogenesis (pus) has
occurred in a mucus fistula there may be more or
less necrotic tissue formed, which will require the
use of an escharotic remedy as well as very hot
water irrigation, followed by an antiseptic remedy,
if not already incorporated in the hot water used.</p>

<p>As a rule I see a fistula case once or twice a
week, as the case may require. There is no packing
of the fistula after the morning and evening
home treatment&mdash;I have never found it essential.
A T-bandage is worn, with absorbent cotton, over
the opening of the fistula, preventing soiling of the
clothes while attending to daily duties.</p>

<p>Never mind what the “Ditto and Me-too” proctologists
have copied or rehashed about the curing
of a fistula, which they persist in calling a
disease. Just be resourceful, safe, and sane in all
you do, and every fistula will get well long before
you have cured the chronic proctitis and sigmoiditis,
of which the fistula, as a rule, is a symptom.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />

<span class="smcap">Nine Radiograph Illustrations of Mucus
Channels and Cavities.</span></h2>


<p>I am indebted to Dr. Caldwell, of New York,
at whose laboratory my patients were radiographed
for the very excellent illustrations; and also
to Dr. Albright of Philadelphia, for his assistance
in the radiograph work, while attending my clinic,
and who, later, with rare skill and scholarly ability,
presented my discoveries in a large volume, entitled;
<i>A Practical Treatise on Rectal Diseases, Their Diagnosis
and Treatment</i>.</p>

<p>The following illustrations can only give a hint of
the pathological conditions that existed. Fig.&nbsp;1
shows seven, and Fig.&nbsp;2, eight probes inserted,
which by no means indicate the number of channels
or size of the cavities; twenty-five to fifty or more
probes inserted would more accurately indicate the
excursions of the inflammatory exudate.</p>

<p>The seven following illustrations, in which Bismuth
Paste was injected, did not meet my expectations
in showing the pathological conditions that
existed. The disappointment was largely due to a
desire not to cause annoyance to my patients, who<span class="pagenum" title="201"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a></span>
so kindly consented, in the interest of science, to being
radiographed. In all cases the paste extended
over a much greater area than a casual glance at
the illustrations would indicate. The probes and
paste were not inserted with the idea of making
a diagnosis, but simply to suggest research on
the subject by proctologists. All the cases radiographed
suffered from proctitis, sigmoiditis, peri­proc­titis,
and peri­sig­moid­itis.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.<br />

<span class="smcap">Chronic Mucous Proctitis and Sigmoiditis&mdash;Usually
Diagnosed as Chronic Mucous
Colitis.</span></h2>


<p>Chronic mucous colitis ought to mean inflammation
of the ascending, transverse, or
descending colon. The length of the rectum varies
from five to eight inches, and the average length
of the sigmoid flexure is about nineteen inches;
the length of the two organs is thirty or more
inches. Chronic follicular, ulcerative proctitis and
sigmoiditis, extending half, or even the whole length
of the sigmoid flexure, causes great suffering, and
the symptoms are similar to those attributed to
chronic mucous colitis. For about thirty years I
have positively known that many of my patients
suffered not only from chronic mucous proctitis,
but from sigmoiditis as well, since I was able to
make positive diagnosis of the diseased condition
for at least ten to fifteen inches up the lower bowels.</p>

<p>If the anal canal is inflamed from any cause and
not cured, the chronic inflammation will gradually
extend up the whole length of the rectum and into
the tissues of the sigmoid flexure, invading the<span class="pagenum" title="203"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a></span>
organ to a greater part of its length, if not all of it.
The sigmoid flexure is the normal receptacle for
feces, and gases, and physiologically and hygienically
ought to be emptied three times in twenty-four
hours to keep it clean for those who are in the
habit of eating food three times a day. The hygienic
condition of the sigmoid receptacle is entirely dependent
upon a healthy condition of the rectum and
a sensible tenant of the body; but when chronic
proctitis has taken possession of the rectum and
neighboring tissues, it serves no longer as a normal
passageway for emptying the sigmoid flexure of
accumulated feces, gases, and liquids.</p>

<p>At first inflammation causes spasmodic muscular
contraction of the anus and rectum, which in time
becomes more and more permanent stricture as the
progress of disease advances, lessening the bore of
the organs until it becomes very difficult for anything
to pass into and through the rectal and anal
canals. Inflammation extending from the rectum
into the sigmoid flexure for perhaps its whole length,
interrupts its functions likewise, thus creating another
cause for undue accumulation of feces and
gases in the organ; this accumulation of the waste
material of the body becomes very foul, generating
toxic gases, putrid substances, and poisonous germs
which in turn irritate and excite the diseased organ
from their constant contact with the follicular ulcerated
mucous membrane of the sigmoid receptacle.
Why should we not find in these cases all the
symptoms attributed by authors to chronic mucous<span class="pagenum" title="204"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a></span>
colitis? Especially so when we have, in addition
to the enumerated symptoms of colitis, those caused
by peri­proc­titis and peri­sig­moid­itis, which are always
present and quite severe.</p>

<p>As a rule, the symptoms which have been diagnosed
as those of chronic mucous colitis, membranous
colitis, or ulcerative colitis are nothing
more than symptoms of chronic mucous proctitis
and sigmoiditis, accompanied by peri­proc­titis and
peri­sig­moid­itis. Proctologists who have written on
the subject of mucous colitis have noted the many
symptoms very accurately, but have missed the
usual location of a most aggravating disease from
which mankind suffers early and late in life. Authors
of books on stomach and intestinal troubles are
also groping very much in the dark and are unable
to diagnose the cause of a very common functional
disturbance of the whole digestive apparatus, caused
by proctitis and sigmoiditis, bringing numerous and
severe primary and secondary symptoms to which
other diseases may be traced.</p>

<p>Chronic proctitis and sigmoiditis and their local
symptoms convert the sigmoid receptacle into an
Augean stable, from which foul poisonous gases
and germs are forced up and along the bowels, distending
the descending and transverse colon and
finally reaching the ascending colon and the cæcum,
causing undue retention of their contents; hence
so much attention to the cæcum and the vermiform
appendix. The ends of a long rubber tube distended
with gas will exhibit more strain and disturbance<span class="pagenum" title="205"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205"></a></span>
than the intermediate parts, and the same
is true of the colon, owing to the intermediate
sections of the organ possessing greater mobility.
The great volume of gases confined in the colon
prevents its normal peristaltic action, causing undue
retention of contents, with resulting inflammation
of the cæcum, as well as dislocation of the stomach,
colon, etc., and suggesting radiographic and fluoroscopic
examination and surgical operations to discover
the cause of all the trouble, which should have
been learned through use of the speculum before
so many complications occurred.</p>

<p>In all cases of chronic mucous proctitis and sigmoiditis
where there is a great amount of secretion
of mucus, membranous cords, shreds, and casts
(called mucous colitis), I have found the marked
acute symptoms more or less periodic and accompanied
by increased inflammation in all the tissues
involved in the disease, which convinced me that
the colitis we read about had become dislocated
and was where I could see its results without the
use of a speculum.</p>

<p>Through often witnessing the phenomena, I have
learned what a “mucous colitis” storm means from a
pathological exhibit, a personal demonstration, and
a verbal description of what the sufferer is enduring.
It requires the stuff heroes are made of to endure
chronic mucous proctitis and sigmoiditis for ten,
thirty, or forty years without the disease being
accurately diagnosed, and to be told that all treatment
is useless and that the trouble is in the head<span class="pagenum" title="206"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a></span>
of the sufferer, that he is a hypochondriac, and a
neurasthenic, terms often used by doctors who are
unable to make a proper diagnosis of a case.</p>

<p>The common symptoms of mucous colitis have
been accepted by writers on the subject, but as to
the real cause of them there has been thus far only
mere conjecture, just as the writers have been
doing as to the cause of pruritus ani, scroti, and
vulvæ. Dr. George M. Niles, of Atlanta, Ga., says:
“In looking up the literature, one is amazed at the
divergent views as to the etiology and management
held by diligent students and competent observers.
It is fairly well agreed that most cases occur in
nervous, neurasthenic, hypochondriac, or hysteric
individuals.” Others blame the liver, hysteria, con­sti­pa­tion,
fermentative processes in the intestines.
How foolish to name symptoms of the disease as a
probable cause of it! It is not necessary for me
to again enumerate the many primary and secondary
symptoms of proctitis and sigmoiditis, but I will
mention briefly a few nervous symptoms which I
think are due to the absorption of mucus into the
system. There is that intense, exasperating, sore,
and restless feeling, with inability to concentrate
the mind, with the nerves and muscles of the body
pinched and contracted. Such feelings are at their
height during an acute mucus storm, which is an
indication of increased inflammation in all the inflamed
tissues, causing secretion of a great quantity
of mucus or membranous casts. No doubt
much of the inflammatory exudate from the mucous<span class="pagenum" title="207"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a></span>
membrane, from the muscular structure of the
organs, and the connective tissue surrounding and
supporting the organs, passes into the sigmoidal and
rectal canals, while a portion is absorbed into the
system. In a similar manner, the inflammatory
exudate from a sub­tegu­men­tary mucus channel and
cavity passes through the skin, causing moisture of
the skin, pruritus ani, scroti, and vulvæ. I know
of no non-malignant disease, where the symptoms
may truly be said to be a thousand times worse
than the disease that caused them, except in chronic
proctitis and sigmoiditis.</p>

<p>Treatment of such cases has been very successful in
my practice, requiring four principal aids: (1) Local
treatment; (2) medicated enemata; (3) local medication;
(4) the recurrent application of medicated
hot water at a temperature of 125 to 135 or more
degrees. A further valuable aid is the determination
of the sufferer to get well by faithfully carrying out
the home treatment. The more a patient studies
my diagnosis and treatment of his case, the more
he is encouraged that eventually a cure will be
effected. Dr. James Moran of this city has been a
student and assistant at my office for more than
three years, and will bear testimony to the success
of my treatment in all cases observed by him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.<br />

<span class="smcap">Antiseptic Employment of Powders and Oils.</span></h2>


<h3>DEPURANT POWDER.</h3>

<p>Water at a temperature of from 120 to 135 or
more degrees is an excellent antiseptic if properly
applied to diseased tissue. Its anti-toxic, soothing,
and healing properties, however, can be vastly
increased by the addition of Depurant remedies.
Water of this temperature, if used in the treatment
of proctitis or colitis, should be applied with the aid
of an Intestinal Recurrent Douche.</p>

<p>Water at a temperature of from 90 to 105 degrees&mdash;which
is recommended for taking an enema&mdash;is
antiseptic or depuratory only to the extent to
which it washes away morbid matter from the intestinal
canal. To increase its antiseptic and therapeutic
value, as well as to meet other requirements,
Depurant remedies are administered with the water
during the flushing of the large intestine.</p>

<p>The Depurant Powder, prepared by the author,
readily dissolves in the warm water and is brought
into contact with every part of the mucous membrane
as far as the antiseptic flushing extends
along the intestine, thus leaving the washed and<span class="pagenum" title="209"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209"></a></span>
sterilized canal sweet and clean&mdash;a fit and proper
channel and receptacle for the on-coming fecal mass.
Here it may remain about four hours without danger
of putre­fac­tion, whereas, were the passage-way
and receptacle foul, the feces would putrefy and
form gases and toxic material in briefer time.</p>

<p>This Depurant remedy is not restricted to intestinal
uses; it is equally efficacious when applied to
the mucous membrane of any part of the body or
to the skin. It may be used effectively for washing
out the bladder or the vagina; for syringing the
ear; for a mouth wash, tooth wash, gargle, nasal
douching or spray; for a throat spray; for bathing
infants; and for internal use where foulness of the
stomach and small intestines exists. It is also a
valuable adjuvant in the use of water for cleansing,
or for hygienic purposes, on all the tissues of the
body.</p>


<h3>DEPURANT OIL.</h3>

<p>Next to the use of water on the mucous membrane
and skin as a hygienic and therapeutic agent,
I am partial to some of our delightful oils, which
are bland, non-irritating, and of a pleasing, nourishing,
refreshing effect and exquisite odor.</p>

<p>To the oil selected as the base ingredient may
be added other oils, and finally attenuated powdered
substances of therapeutic value in soothing, purifying,
healing, or any other purpose the case may call
for. Pure olive oil is an excellent substance in which
to incorporate Depurant remedies, especially when<span class="pagenum" title="210"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a></span>
designed to be taken internally, by way of the
mouth, or applied to the integument of the body.
Certain other oils are equally pleasing though
rather expensive. However, an inexpensive oil
usually serves as a base in which to embody the
proper medicinal remedies for Depurant purposes
in the treatment of proctitis and colitis.</p>

<p>By a proper instrument the oil is carried into the
intestines with the water used in flushing the colon,
or that used with the intestinal recurrent douche
treatment. The oil, being lighter than the water,
is carried ahead or on top as the water passes up the
bowels; and, as the two liquids open the crevices
and folds of the mucous membrane or canal, every
part of the latter is completely covered with the
medicated oil, as with a covering of thin salve, ointment,
or a poultice&mdash;in every nook and corner, just
where it is most needed and where it should remain
for its hygienic and healing effect.</p>

<p>Every kindly aid should be given a diseased
organ, mucous membrane, or the skin, even if one
knows it is for relief only; for the very aids that
give relief are often essential when joined with
medicinal or other treatment in effecting a cure.</p>

<p>It is advantageous in treating bowel troubles to
use a rather heavy, tenacious oil for a base&mdash;one
that may not be so pleasant to swallow or to use
externally as some of the lighter oils. It is therefore
advisable to have two kinds of Depurant Oil:
one for internal use (by the mouth) and for the skin,
the other for chronic disease of the lower bowel.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="tac fs140"><i>By Alcinous B. Jamison, M.D.</i>,</p>

<p class="tac fs90 mtb1em">SPECIALIST IN RECTAL, ANAL, AND BOWEL DISEASES, AND<br />
AUTHOR OF “HOW TO BECOME STRONG.”</p>

<p class="tac"><i>Cloth, 277 pages</i></p>


<p>The above is the title of a work for non-professional
readers on the cause and cure of many forms of
bowel and stomach trouble, and their consequences,
and the scientific treatment of piles, fistula, pruritus
ani (itching), etc.</p>

<p>Science is here reduced to common sense; and
the intelligent layman, following the directions of
this book, especially as to “physiological irrigation,”
will be able to prevent the usual daily foul state of
the stomach and bowels. Here is set forth in plain
language the accumulated experience of a thoughtful
physician, who for over thirty years has studied the
welfare of his patients in the treatment of those
diseases which are peculiar to civilization. During
this long practise, patients from all parts of the
United States and other countries have come to New
York City to be under the humane and skilful care
of Dr. Jamison, who has the unique reputation of
never employing the barbarous surgical and hospital
methods in vogue throughout the world. No knife,
ligature, clamp, or cautery has ever been employed
by him in the treatment of even the most aggravated
case of piles, or hemorrhoids; and no detention from
business is necessary under his treatment for this
symptom of proctitis.</p>

<p>Dr. Jamison’s discoveries in the line of his specialty
have added much to medical knowledge concerning
the etiology and pathology of proctitis, sigmoiditis,
and of their symptoms&mdash;hemorrhoids, pruritus
ani, con­sti­pa­tion, etc. His diagnosis of these afflictions
is original, as well as his treatment of such
ailments&mdash;hitherto neglected or improperly cared for.</p>

<p>Physicians and surgeons of conventional schools
of medicine are not aware that the common cause,
and indeed the key, of all forms of anal, rectal, and
bowel trouble is proctitis (inflammation of the lower
bowel and sometimes of the colon); that proctitis is
the cause of nearly all cases of con­sti­pa­tion, diarrhea,
indigestion, and biliousness; and that, finally, proctitis
is the cause of auto-infection (self-poisoning)
and its outcome&mdash;anemia, emaciation, etc.</p>

<p>No book to which physicians have access treats
this subject so fully as “Intestinal Ills,” and yet in
this volume it is presented in a popular manner suited
to the common understanding.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
